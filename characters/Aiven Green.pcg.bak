# Campaign History
CHRONICLEENTRY:N:|CAMPAIGN:Craig's Game|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:7/27/2013|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:Craig|CHRONICLE:Started out life as a guard to a caravan. Ended up in a town eating lunch when overheard a conversation about locals that were hiding out and/or lost while exploring a near by wizards tower. Began investigation of tower.&nl;&nl;John and Sturn fought to find out that there was an closet like coat room at the entrance of the tower. They discovered a large number of discarded rags and pieces of cloth that may have been cloaks at one time. Investigated what looked to be a bedroom. Discovered nothing of value. Looked to be unused in many moons.&nl;&nl;Investigation continued in a nearby library. John found "Finnots Book" inside library of abandoned tower. Barrow found a scroll case with scroll of Flaming Sphere, Grease, Detect Magic, and three other spells that were unidentified at time of discovery. . I found what looks like a planar map. Additionally there was evidence of squatters who potentially used some of the books as fuel for a fire.&nl;&nl;The next room looked like a bedroom again. A corpse was located on the bed. Most of it seemed rotted away. Looked like the corpse had been here for a few months. As Barrow got closer to the body on the bed a pair of shambling undead looking creatures jumped out to attack the party. John later identified them as a devil, an outsider called a Lemure. The creatures did not take as much damage as we thought we were doing. It completely absorbed my sling bullet without effect. John hacked away mercilessly after they were felled. I quickly stepped away to avoid getting ichor all over myself. John and Sturn venture into a closet where they find a dead peasant girl. She carried with her a few copper (4) and some carved piece of wood, similar in size and shape to a wand. Speculation that this is the missing girl that was talked about in the tavern. &nl;&nl;The next room investigated was in the southwest portion of the bottom floor of the tower. Some walls were broken in and showed the outside. Barrow and I began searching around in the room when John and Sturn walked off. As we were searching John and Sturn returned to the room and John began assisting with the searching. In the southwest corner of the room was a crumbling fireplace. Barrow pulls out 5 vials of unknown contents. Three are in flasks while two are more vials of something. Perhaps oil and potions. No other things were discovered. (OOG - Possible secret room for missing area on the map)&nl;&nl;In the northeast corner was two rooms with nearby doors. Sturn opened the door to the east while John opens the door to the west. The eastern most room looked to be very much like a kitchen with foodstuffs scattered throughout. Cursory glance revelead nothing. The western  room was a bit more interesting. It appeared to be a dining room. When John opened the door he was assailed by mold. The party engaged the mold/ooze stuff. Sturn and John were both attacked where the mold attached to the body. John became paralyzed during the altercation. Barrow was able to hack off the tendril that reached out to paralyze John. Sturn attempted to hack it off of himself unsuccessfully. I was able to throw a flame that I produced at the creature, killing it. Sturn decided to walk into the room and suffered some acid burns upon his feet after the ooze detached from the ceiling and floor and splashed everywhere. (Fix story, ooze was in the kitchen)&nl;&nl;The next few moments were spent with myself and Barrow attempting to bring the fighters back up to proper health.  &nl;&nl;After the group was healed up I spent some time searching in the dining room. I discovered a secret door along the eastern wall down a short corridor. The secret room was a secondary entrance into the wizards lab. John was able to discovered a book titled "Lab notes" where the wizard seemed to talk about traveling and/or contacting other planes. "Aha! I found it. A way to transport myself both spiritually and bodily" was found inside the notebook. This was the final note in the book. While John and Sturn perused the book, Barrow was able to find a second secret door inside the mages laboratory. &nl;&nl;Our adventure continued through the secret door discovered inside the wizards lab. This door appears to connect to a small breezeway which contains a single door to a semi-rounded wall. We currently assume that this attaches to the circular tower behind the small outbuilding. John opened the door. He finds a vaulted chamber that opens up about 30 feet. There seems to be a pale blue light emanating from walls. The dome is supported by buttresses and the far walls are lined with alchemical equipment. Vials and other are all over a table. In addition, dust seems to cover everything inside the room. In the center of the floor was a circle of writing. Sturn walks up to the circle holding back a sneeze as he walks through the dust covered room. &nl;&nl;John attempted to leave the room while I stood outside. He found himself making a faceplant into an unseen wall. Barrow began pounding on the unseen wall to no avail. I pushed in my spear and it stuck hanging in the air. I was unable to pull it out or pull another person out with it. I try to back away to assess the situation to find &lbracket;DOG&rbracket; got his paw stuck in the force. Resigned to not let &lbracket;DOG&rbracket; die without me, I pressed forward into the room. While this was occurring the writing on the floor began glowing brighter blue. John, began grabbing at vials on the table and the alchemical vials.&nl;&nl;Bright light flashed, Barrow and Sturn (and &lbracket;DOG&rbracket;) become partially blinded. We find ourselves in some place new....&nl;&nl;More lettering started to glow out forming 6 pieces of a pie shape on the floor. &nl;&nl;6 vials on the table, John - 3 (1) magic, John drops two. 2 more potions found. Two on wall, one on table. 6 vials were on the table. 1 was magical. 3 magic on wall. 1 magic on table. Assorted non magic. John picked up a number and dropped the non magical that broke on the floor. I found a magical dagger hidden behind the alchemical wall. barely discovered due to the increased glowing from the floor. I have one, John has one. Barrow had two. Mine was conjuration. One of Barrows is transmutation.&nl;&nl;The smell of sulphur and ozone permeate the air around us as we stand disoriented in a new location. The blue glow is now gone and we find ourselves inside an exact replica of the diagram that teleported us. However, the stones around us are black and the script is in gold. We are met with a &lbracket;intake of breath&rbracket; gasp and find ourselves face to face with what appears to be a fiend. Some winged gray creature chewing on an unidentified leg. The creature is three feet tall, and a spiked tail. It seems to fear our presence. It begins backing away towards the stone wall upon seeing us. Sturn waves at the creature and it hesitantly waves back at us. We are on a circular platform of rock. There is a glow about us permeating the air. We can only really see the plateau we are on.&nl;&nl;Sturn asks the creature where we are at. The creature identifies our location as "The nine planes". Sturn requested a better description from the creature. He identifies us in Baator immediately after Barrow and I are looking at the map. I count the number of "levels" in one section of the map and see us in Baator and mention that to Barrow. We are told we are on Averness, the first of the nine planes of hell. I ask the creature what it is called, it responds with "Halicksoo." We suspect that the creature is a fiend, John calls it a "Spinagon", a lesser betazu (devil). Halisksoo identifies this plateau as a one-way portal to Averness. Halicksoo called us "cutters" Pointed off towards "that way" stating there might be a portal off in those mountains. We will have to cross a river of blood or poison. Halicksoo has been extremely helpful providing information to us about bridges and ferries to get us across the river. I reserve my opinions about his intentions. Halicksoo volunteers us information about visiting the "mad witch" east towards the mountains. He states that she can be found inside those mountains. He describes her as "an old planar", like all of us, human. Halicksoo is "posted" here and is supposed to report about invasions. He states that he's been here for 300 years. Also admits that the "old witch" is at least as old as he. Directions provided are to "head towards the river of blood, cross it." John asks "is slavery is common here". Halicksoo stares back at him blankly. Halicksoo further expands on the information he provides indicating that our souls may be used as currency around this area. The implication that I understand is that we should avoid the cities and major civilizations here.  Barrow asks "what's off that way?" pointing west of us. Halicksoo states simply "The war". Explaining that it's been going on for about 200 years to destory the tunari. The terrible tunari. The demons. He explains the demons are looking for chaos and wanton destruction. Whereas his kind feel that there should be order and reason for the decisions made. "If you go to the river and head south, we should arrive at the capital city. If we can retain an audience with Belle, he may barter with us to exchange a couple of our souls to return a couple of us back to our home plane, he cautions courteousy with Belle as he is powerful and expects respect.&nl;&nl;The group then discusses that we probably do not want to head towards the wastelands or the war. Halicksoo further volunteers that there are known to be portals out in the wasteland and recommends that we go towards the mountains. &nl;&nl;Barrow takes a moment to jot down our location and some information about what we got from Halicksoo on our current geography. We begin our trek off of the plateau, Halicksoo watches us as we depart, heading towards the mountains. As we are walking we notice a number of fireball like explosions overhead. The thought is that these seem to be "naturally" occuring phenomena. We walk for a couple of hours and attempt to find ourselves a reasonable place to camp for the evening. After walking for two miles we come over a hill to find that we're approximately a mile away from the river. We decide to back down the hill and find ourselves a defensible outcropping of rock to hide under and rest. &nl;&nl;I cast create water into my newly emptied backpack to get 1 gallon and 3 quarts worth of water. We were able to fully replenish our expended water supply, but quickly realize that we'll need more water in order to not fall behind. Rations seem to be a potential problem as we have our dicsussions.&nl;&nl;Our evening continues to go throughout the night uneventfully. Waking up we walk out of our outcropping to find an army of hundreds of creatures south of us. It appears that they are running some sort of military drills. A couple of us notice that there are fliers included in the midst of this group. We decide that north would be our best way to circumvent this new threat. About a half hour later we feel that we successfully avoided the army and came upon the river of blood. We hear something howling or moaning. We notice a fork of the river coming directly from the mountains and feel that this direction is where the moaning seems to come from. We think we see shapes of faces contorted in agony moaning and howling inside the river. Twenty feet down the river we see what could be a ford that we would be able to cross the river on. &nl;&nl;John suggests this as our current best option to cross the river. We estimate the width of the river to be 100 yards at this ford area. Barrow notices smoke somewhere up in the mountains. Possibly from a chimney of fire of some sort. Sturn gets tired of us trying to figure out where to go and begins walking off from the rest of the group north along the river. We come across a 2nd, more sparse, ford about 50 yards north. Barrow suggests returning to the first ford and attempting there. He also suggests tying together with some rope before beginning the ford. As we get to the ford location we notice a boar rooting around on the other side of the river. As we were crossing the river, the boar moves off. Everyone (Barrow) got splashed by the river as he crossed and suffered no immediately ill effects from the splashing. It was discomforting and a little disgusting, but he was unhurt.&nl;&nl;Barrow decides to head towards the smoke. I agree, because I want to stay with the cleric. We discover that the source of the smoke was found from inside a cave. Upon reaching the cave we are met by a woman who seems to be 'guarding' the cave. Spying us, she immediately casts a spell. I found myself stuck inside a web, fortunately &lbracket;DOG&rbracket; was able to keep out of the web. John yelled out "whoa whoa whoa, friendly". She responds "Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were fiends, I thought you were with him". Turning around we find ourselves being followed by a fiend. The imp states "No no, I'm only a messenger". She dispels the web, releasing me and dropping me to the ground. The imp immediately bolts.&nl;&nl;She pulls out a lens to look us all over. Barrow thinks the lens is used to detect evil. Barrow asks "Are you the one that they call the 'old witch'" she responds "Well, they call me the mad witch. I'm Hexla, at least that's what they call me back home". She invites us into her home/cave. Inside the cave we see a large seating area with large table and asks us to wait here. She brings out food and drink for all of us. Including a dish specifically of water to provide to &lbracket;DOG&rbracket; whom I asked to stay near the door of the cave out of politeness. She asks us what brings us here. We mention our desire to get home. She offers that if we wish to leave, we should visit the Pillar of Skulls and ask it... interjections occur from Sturn, who is confused about asking "it" anything. She states to ask it about a key and that we will need to be more clever than it. It is said that the pillar is made from petitioners who lied for a living. It will try to cut a deal with us, but it will try to get the better end of the deal. Follow the river to a culdesac in the bend of the river. head to the right towards the hills in the plain, soon we will reach the pillar. If we want to get information from it, we'll need to pay in music. Be prepared to give it something. And most of all, do not trust anyone here. Barrow "Including you", "You cannot even be sure that I'm telling the truth". i ask how far the pillar is. "Less than half a days travel". She offers to provide us with more food and water. I ask her if she has berries, but she politely informs me that she does not. &nl;&nl;"If you come across any sweet grass or bat skulls, I could use those" Barrow&colon; "What does sweet grass look like?" Hexla "Crab grass." she describes the grass. "If you bring me those things, I could probably get you off of this plane". I give her one of my wood carvings as way of thanks for her hospitality. &nl;&nl;We follow Hexla's directions towards the Pillar of skulls. We come upon it and find it is composed of many skulls from a variety of races. The skulls are talking. we are able to discern conversations, squabbles, discussions. As we approach and are noticed, the skulls immediately stop all conversation in common. They begin speaking in some language that none of us recognize. &nl;&nl;One skull bellows out "'nuff!" and the pillar falls silent. I recognize the large head as an ogre head. And elf head says "Somebody knock out the ogre!" "John requests a way for the portal for a way off this plane" "I will tell three of you. One of you will be a sacrifice" Elf&colon; "Really, knock out the ogre" The ogre would say "'nuff" and the pillar would go silent. John throws a bola at the ogre head. The ogre dodges the first blow. He picks up his bola to attempt again. "Quit!" the ogre responds. I ask the halfling if it knows where the portal to the prime material plane is. It nods, indicating it does. &nl;&nl;Barrow hits the ogre head and the pillar goes into some chant "aaaahhhhh" and soon stops. The ogre head says "Wait... wait..." The pillar attacks John, it summoned an imp that stung him. Barrow attempts to smack the imp as it's attempting to back away from the confrontation.  As the others are combating the imp, I ask the pillar "What's going on over there? Are you fighting my friends?" Pillar responds "Oh, no no no no, They summoned a guardian" "Who?" "Those guys over there, it just takes 10 of us". As the rest of the group fights the imp, I try to converse with the pillar to get them to call off the guardian. I sigh and say "OK, have it your way" and turn to attack the imp. &nl;&nl;After we destroy the imp, I suggest that we head out from here. The party heads back towards the mad witchs cave....&nl;&nl;&nl;&nl;NOTE&colon; I spent one action point
CHRONICLEENTRY:N:|CAMPAIGN:Craig's Game|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:8/9/13|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:After the combat with the imp, we retreat, licking our wounds. As we were departing, the tower told us to bring it a fiend. John decided to drag the imp's corpse along with us. We walked what I would gauge as 3/4 of the way back to the witches cave before feeling like we need to retire for the evening. I try to find a serviceable place for us to camp for the night. I spend some time using a backpack to Create Water into so that we may fill up our waterskins and water Willow. The night turns pitch dark.&nl;&nl;Watch order, Aiven, John, Storn, Barrow. After our watch order was established I sat quietly in the dark gently stroking Willow, feeling for any sign that she might hear or see something. I sat prepared with torch in nearby and flint and steel in hand with whistle ready to blow. &nl;&nl;During Storns watch, Willow awoke me with a low growling. Soon after I hear a growly voice saying "HEAL ME!". I tried to light a torch to see whatever was upon us in the night. An ugly creature I've never seen before is upon Barrow. I tell Willow to guard me, which she does obediently. The creature continues with "Heal me, and I will let you live." John stands up and draws his weapon. Barrow shoves the creature, attempting to shove it off of him shouting "Why in Shadacar would I want to do that?" Barrow was semi-successful, the creature seems to be helping Barrow stand and released him.  I ask, "Why should we heal you when you sneak up on us in the middle of the night?" "It's custom, you were sleeping, I woke you up. i could have ripped out the dwarves throat and forced you to heal me." Barrow, "Who are you and what are you?" Creature "I'm Bleck", Barrow "What are you?" Creature "Someone who needs healing" Barrow "If I'm healing something I need to know what it is." "Meilikki will not allow me to heal something whos anatomy I cannot recognize", Creature "You worship Meilikki?" me; "I do", Creature "I could really use some healing, I don't want to kill you folks" Barrow, "Where did you come from" C&colon; "The war", B "Why are you out here?" C "I got a message to deliver" I heal it "That is all Meilkki will allow me without knowing more about you. What are you?" "I'm Bleck, I'm from the North",  "What is your species?" Creature&colon; "Babau" a tenari. We barter with it, indicating that we must wait until morning. He says "Don't touch me, it will melt your hand off" as he walks off to take a watch to allow us to sleep. He begins oozing some blacky ichor around it's body. We try to sleep. &nl;&nl;(Torch is burned 10m off)&nl;&nl;I ask Meilikki to grant me the power to cure this creature Bleck the Babau.  My request is granted. John tells us more about the babau, indicating it is a Tenari. &nl;&nl;I tell Bleck that Meilikki has granted the request, but he must come with us to whence we came. Barrow heals, and tells Bleck that it must return a favor. After some negotiation, Bleck decides not to accept my healing and to leave the group. John mentions he could use a favor. He tells Bleck that he wants Bleck to come to the pillar of skulls to play dead. Some negotiation takes place, John's soul is currently on the table. John trades the wood carving for 1pp. Another healing spell from me and we've convinced Bleck to come back to the pillar to "play dead". We tie together with a rope and follow Storn as he leads us back towards the pillar of skulls. We wind our way throught he pitch black towards the pillar of skulls. About 100 yards away, Bleck stops and lays down. Some discussion occurs, and we decide to bring the fiend, on its own volition, back to the pillar. I have reservations about this and am a bit nervous. &nl;&nl;We get back to the pillar. "Oh, you're back". Skull says "The portals about 5 days from here" Bleck says "Just one soul, I'll show you how to get out" John offers a magic potion, the one we have yet to identify, Bleck tries to take it out of his hand  and does so with dramatic flair, but John is able to hold fast to the potion. Bleck asks "What is it?" John says "Cure moderate wounds", bluffing through his teeth. Bleck request three of these potions to take us to the portal. The pillar offers to give us directions for the potion. Eventually Bleck steps away and teleports himself out. John accepts this deal and places the potion&nl;&nl;A gnome head tells us that the portal if 5 days from here, south across the river. You can go straight south across the river, but eventually you will hit keep or road but you don't want to meet people there. Cross the river, head south west, cross river again and head towards foot hills. You will see river again, head due south after crossing the river a third time and you will find the portal. The key to access the portal is a brick. Another skulls says "no no no, it's not a brick, it's a bracelet" "no no no, it changes form, it's an obsidian stone last I think". "no no no, it's any obsidian stone that's been exploded by a fireball". I say "NUFF!" after the pillar begins to enter into arguments and discussions. It ignores me. They start talking about other portals in the keep, and other discussions. Eventually they come to a concensus and an elf head says "What you do, you go to the Great Averness road, it's a big road that comes out of the keep. Go there quick and leave quick, the stuff there might kill you. That's the closest portal, we're not sure where it goes btu we're pretty sure it goes to the prime material, you take a brick from the averness road, an obsidian brick, you each need one, and you take them to the portal where you step through backwards with the brick" You will see two upright pillars like ears, you step through those backwards. " John "You're sure about this?" P&colon; "We're mostly sure". The great road of averness comes out of the great keep south of here. &nl;&nl;I say we should head back and Storn starts to lead us back. &nl;&nl;After stopping at our crater we see two blue lights fly over head, we were able to identify it as the Arcane Sight spell. We press on towards the witch's place&nl;&nl;When we arrive at the witches cave she comes out and says "You must leave, now"&nl;&nl;Witch through a message spell. "They know you've been here, you need to leave quickly"&nl;&nl;We travel about an hour south and we soon see a light to the south of us. It looks like it might be a campfire. I suggest that we approach the campfire, cautiously. I proceed to move towards the fire with caution. We find Clubbum and Carl, Carl has blue glowing eyes and Clubbum carries a very large club. We barter to trade the imp corpse for 10 days rations of food, 1 water skin and fill all of our water containers. He has Clubbum move a boulder, Carl hands off a Decantur of endless water for us to fill all of our water skins and get enough to drink.&nl;&nl;John "How did you get here?" Carl &colon; "Sigil, I took a gate through Sigil to get here, it's a two way, it sends you and then pulls you back". It's in a backroom of a weaponsmith in Sigil, it's kind of neat, I put on this bracelet and it will portal me back.&nl;&nl;Barrow "Where's this weaponsmith at?" Carl "Barriar blades, in Sigil" Carl gives us a continual light stone and sells one to John for 10gp. Carl says "and remember, the red wizards of Thay are not all bad". &nl;&nl;Just as we begin to go to sleep after Carl and Clubbum leave, the day returns and we're basked in daylight. We establish our watches to begin our evening rest. We head rest after an uneventful "night" and come to the river, but find no ford. &nl;&nl;I fall in three times, I get bit on the ankle by a large wormy thing.(giant bloodworm). Huge bloodworm. Barrow is also attacked by a bloodworm.&nl;&nl;After fighting off the two bloodworms we make our way southwest. Soon we come again to the river, we decide it's a good time to camp and set off to the south to an outcropping we see a short distance away. &nl;&nl;Trying to ford our second river, Barrow and John fall in combat with additional worms as Barrow missed his final jump and was attacked by a blood worm.&nl;&nl;Witch walks into camp after two nights. Informs us that "Baal (bell)" is looking for us. He knows we're here and beware of his spies. They are everywhere, don't trust anybody" The witch gives Storn 6 berries, informs him to feed our friends these berries one at a time. in the morning, Storn is less than forthcoming about the berries he received when I woke confused about how John and Barrow were awake. I healed both of them after my morning prayers.&nl;&nl;(Notes, Bleck is bipedal, John estimated half health)&nl;&nl;(Make wood carvings for equivalent of 1month of carving)&nl;
CHRONICLEENTRY:N:|CAMPAIGN:Craig's Game|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:9/7/13|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:I suggest that we find another place to camp, as we've been here for two days. Panacea (Miniatures Handbook p38)&nl;&nl;Storn handed a goodberry to both Barrow and John, they were both awakened. As Storn and Barrow talked about the goodberries, I awoke. We had a short conversation where Barrow identified the berries as enchanted with the spell Panacea. I suggest that we find another place to camp in the morning, as we've been here for two days. I healed the Barrow and John so that we could continue our journey. We head generally south-west. We found the river again and decided to find a ford. We see in the distance a bridge over the river that is being guarded or watched by some skeletal figure. The party decides to circumvent the bridge, knowing the Bell is looking for us. The skeleton points at John as we're walking past. Barrow suggests that we point back and continue on. John points back and the skeleton motions us to come towards him. I suggest that we heed the summoning, as it would likely be safer to find out what it wants rather than obviously attemping to avoid the encounter.&nl;&nl;John approaches closer as the rest of us wait off of the bridge. The skeleton looks more wraith-like than skeletal. It whispers something inaudible. The wraiths eyes glow and John begins to move closer to the wraith. I recognize that the wraith casts command upon John. John withdraws back to the group, Barrow casts a spell. I walk closer and ask what it wants. I feel the command magic saying "Step up to me." He casts again. I withdraw to the group and suggest we either step up, fight or flee. Barrow suggests we walk right past it. I see something black flying overhead as the party discusses our next action. Barrow attempts to turn the wraith, but is unsuccessful. He attempts again, and is again unsuccessful. Another unsuccessful attempt. John moves closer onto the bridge. John is again commanded to go up closer, he comes up and the group approaches. John tumbles past the wraith and attacks it from behind. I tried to yell at him to stop but was too late. John says to run past, and the wraith attacks back. Storn also attacks the wraith and misses. Barrow attempts to walk past the wraith. I jump off of Willow and attempt to lead her past the wraith. The wraith swipes out at me and misses, then swipes out at Willow to which it connects. Combat continues, and John attacks and misses. Storn runs past the wraith and is struck along the way. We all got past the wraith and continue on our journey south. &nl;&nl;After crossing the bridge, we travel see in the distance a black strip crossing the expanse out to the east of us. We change course slightly towards the road. We notice that there is an army on the road as we get closer. We dive behind an outcropping in an attempt to escape notice. We wait behind the outcropping for about 10 minutes. John peeks out and sees something flying out from the mountains to our east. John squishes back to hid close into the outcropping when a pair of eyes open up on the rock in front of him. As he steps back the eyes close. &nl;&nl;After about 2.5 hours, the army passes into the distance. Barrow tells John to go scout. A goblin bursts out of the outcropping as John moves away. I try to attack it and miss. A couple more attacks and the goblin planeshifts away. &nl;&nl;We proceed to the road to pick up our stones. We begin complete our stone gathering and most of us notice a flock of "flying things" heading south towards us from the mountains in the distance. Barrow notice an outcropping south-west of us and suggests we head towards that. The flock heads our direction off of the road. We try to hide briefly, but based on their movement decide to flee. After an hour of fleeing, we notice the flock has gained some ground on us. We also notice what we perceive as the portal about two hours away. After three hours of running we get to the outcropping and start up the hill to get to the portal. The flock catches up to us as we're hustling up the hill. As we crest the top of the portal, the creatures fly past us. The creature looks to be some winged lizard creature with horns. 20 are black, 10 are red, larger and shouting out the black ones. &nl;&nl;At the portal we see a man before us. The figure raises both hands as we draw near. He has extraordinarily long fingernails. He appears to offer no harm as he welcomes us with "What ho good travelers, I bid you good well and good hope. I am Arkumens, the guardian of this portal." John, "I would like to return to my homeland" Ark, "If you wish to go past me, you must do me a favor, you must take this orb through the portal with you." John "What's this orb do?" Ark "It will not harm you directly." Other dialog occurs. Ark says "I cannot take the orb through, I am the guardian." He indicates that the creatures above are his friends. "I must ask only three times before I can work my magic on you. Take this orb before I did, if you drop it before you go through I will hunt you through all the planes of existence."  'Let me see your stone' "Ding" Me "Where does this lead to?" "The other side" We step through the portal after John with the orb.&nl;&nl;On the other side we step through an archway into the bustle of a city. It does not resemble any city we've seen before. Fiends and angels walk through this city. The orb crumbled to dust as soon as we stepped through the portal. John says "Sir" directed towards the angel. Sedan chairs are being carried around with other creatures. Vendors hawking their wares. We seem to be in a market place. We spy humanoids we've never seen before, such as centaur, half-ram half-man. And all are dressed very elegantly. &nl;&nl;John continues to try to draw the attention of an angel. He asks "What's the name of this city?" He tells us some name of the city "Sigil, the center of the multi-verse". Me "Where can I get a bath?" Angel "Bathhouse, walk down the street till you see the bathhouse" We begin our walk towards the bathhouse. We pass by an inn, and find a bathhouse after about 10 minutes. We all purchase our baths, and John asks for a tailor. During our bath the tailor arrives and John requests that the tailor make him silk ninja robes. The tailor quotes him 115 gold for these service. John "Can I just purcahse the material?" Tailor "I can sell you silk, it would be 60 gold." John "Could you produce a scholars outfit?" Tailor "Alright, 10 gold." John proffers the agreed upon price and the tailor begins his measurements. John heads back towards the marketplace to find himself a backpack. &nl;&nl;"We need to find some temples I think. I need to pray to Meilikki, badly." A random guy says "I know where the shrine to Meilikki is." Barrow says "No" before I have a chance to indicate any kind of response. We exchange a look. Barrow "Let's establish an inn, so we can gather some information from the innkeeper. That guy was probably lying to us." A pair of what appear to be guards are escorting a pair of individuals whom have their hands bound behind their backs. We arrive at the inn, the sign indicates we are at the "The Way Inn". The Inn looks like it's a busy place, a variety of beings are present in the common room. A bouncer at the door asks me "Is that under your full command?" Me&colon; "Yes" Bouncer "If it bites, it's as if you bit."  I am able to identify the bouncer as a Half-Ogre. John "We need a room for 5." Innkeeper "Five of you in one room? That'll be 10 gold" Barrow "Where is the temple district?" Me "I'd like to find a shrine or temple to Meilikki" InnKeeper "There's no temple to Meilikki here" Me&colon; "How about a forested area?" Innkeeper "Not unless the Lady Pain allowed it, she's like a god here, she creates everything here" Innkeeper tells us how to get to &lbracket;Barrows temple&rbracket;. John retires to the room while the rest of us make the trip to the Chondakal Temple. &nl;&nl;We walk around for a time, I counsel that we return to the inn and rest before making the long trek. We walk around for a brief time and return to the inn and order a hot meal. We eat our meal and enjoy a pair of minstrels who give a stellar performance. &nl;&nl;Our suite has a common room with a "futon" and three other rooms with beds. Our night goes through uneventfully and we make it to what feels like morning. We go downstairs and have our breakfast before heading towards the temple area. As we are breakign our fast, a tall man sits down at our table and says "I'm glad you're still here, I'm sorry I'm late. I understand you guys can solve problems, for a price" "What problems?" "I would like you enlist you to deliver a letter to my lover. By whatever means, I care not for her family. If you accept, I must request that you treat the lady with respect. I would give you a handsome reward of a magical item and 250 gold pieces?" John "How dangerous will this mission be and what will this magic item be?" "Every mission has some degree of danger. I can get you very close to her, and you just have to deliver the message and come back." John "Who is your beloved?" Man "Her name is Chiryn. (Keeren)" John, "Where might we find such a person?" Man "The outlands of the abyss." Barrow "Are you providing the means of egress there and back" (dialog, She's a tenari) "Her family would kill me if I went to the abyss" I burst out during the dialog "I'm out" Man "I have a leading stone that would lead you right to her" Storn "Could we get some payment up front?" The man puts a crystal, a bag of holding with (10 platinum pieces) and a sealed letter, he shows us that the letter appears blank and that no one can read it except her" He indicates that he was directed to us by a posting on a board, noting us as the "hearty adventurers who conquered the abyss."  The man heads to another group of four people sitting at another table.&nl;&nl;We begin our trek across Sigil to visit Chondakal's temple. As we are walking through town we find a gemshop after a while. John sells off his obsidian for 3gp to the gemdealer after a series of poor haggling. Storn gives his away to the gemdealer. As we begin walking back through the town, John is bumped aggressively by a Vrock. He shouts out "You, stop!" Vrock, "Yeah?" John "You took something from me?" Vrock "No, you wanna shake on it?" John reaches out and takes the proferred hand and is damaged by the spores that the vrock displaces. John follows the Vrock hollering for the guards as the rest of us head towards the temple. Barrow asks "Why are you following him?" John "He's killing me" Barrow "I dno't think he was trying to steal from you, I think he was trying to start trouble." John walks away calling for the guards and following the vrock. John tears out some of the plants covering his entire body after the Vrock attack. Random satyr says "Holy water will take care of that" &nl;&nl;After about 20 minutes heading towards the temple, another Vrock seems to be heading directly towards us. He shoulder bumps John again agressively. We see a group of 3 goblins go by, and we all feel like one of the goblins was leering at us. We stop at a fountain to eat our lunch. We see an angelic creature walk up to John and touches him. The vines quickly dissolve and fall off of him. She looks at Barrow "A simple bless will take care of that" &nl;&nl;"Pst, come here" John stops to talk, while the rest of the group ignores the peddler in the alley. "Come here" John "nah" Alley "There's 5000 gold in it" John "Nah, no thanks" he catches up to the group. Another time walking, 5 people come walking by, one with a crown and royal garb. 4 others are obvious guards. We see a wizard walking a few steps behind. I also identify a rogue in waiting following the group. I mention to one of the guards in passing "You have a shadow." We keep walking. The wizard passes by us and says to me "Good eyes, he's with us." John later identifies them as the "Purple Dragons of Cormyr." "The king or some nobility from the heart of Cormyr." We finally arrive at the church of Choadkal.&nl;&nl;As we walk up to the doors, we find them locked. Barrow knocks on the door and it cracks open. John waits outside while the rest of us enter the temple. Barrow says a blessing to Chondakal as he enters and begins to go through his pious services. We see nobody around in the temple and assume that nobody is present. Barrow knocks on the door to what appears to be an office, the door cracks open, we look around and find no one. Things look a bit dusty as if no one has been here in a while. There is an obvious note on the desk that says "If you're reading this, you are clergy, we are not here right now. Will return eventually. The Lady of Pain only allows us to study portals. Be wary of cataloguing and frequent use." After Barrow completes his cataloguing and clergy duties, we exit the temple and the door closes behind us. Barrow, "Now that I've done my duty, where do the winds want to take us?"&nl;&nl;We find the temple of Corellen and are met by a group of elves. "are you here for the shrine?" "I'm looking for the shrine to Meilikki" "We have it out back." "Could you take us there?" I take 24 berries, 3 turn out to be goodberries. I eat one of the good berries. We each partake of the goodberries that the druid identifies for us. "They should be good for about 10 days" Barrow, John and Storn try to determine what the potions and spells are that we found. &nl;&nl;Barrow asks the elves if they would know what the spells are that are on our scrolls and in our vials while I am enjoying my time in the shrine area for Meilikki. After some deliberation, we were able to sell our scroll of spells for 350 gold (30pp, 10gp). The wizard offers to ID vials for 5gp, One is levitate, I would guess healing on the other two, they are conjuration. (76.25gp, 7pp, 6gp 3sp -5cp)&nl;&nl;John asks the elf "watching" us if he can point us back the prime material into Faerun, preferably Cormyr or Waterdeep. They offer to teleport us back home for 500gp. &nl;&nl;I ask about a marketplace closer by, the elves tell me. They do not allow us all to stay here, though they do consider allowing me to stay within the shrine. They offer us a 2% commission on the sale of a magic carpet for 60k. &nl;&nl;We head back across the street, and take temporary residence for the evening in the temple of Chondakal. &nl;&nl;(use one action point, also replenish for leveling) &nl;(DM Ruling, I cannot grapple without taking an unarmed attack penalty)
CHRONICLEENTRY:N:|CAMPAIGN:Craig's Game|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:9/14/13|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:Craig|CHRONICLE:We start out our next morning with usual abulations. I retire across the street to do my prayers at the shrine to Meilikki. I collect two additional berries while partaking of the berry bush for breakfast. After we get all of our morning rituals completed we head to the marketplace to replenish supplies. I was able to acquire a set of saddlebags for Willow (5gp). John sells off some Ninja gear to get some other clothes. We spend some additional time orienting ourselves with the marketplace and trying to identify a place where there might be a job board. I suggest we could go back to ask the elves about where such a board might be. We have a discussion about where to go next. As we are talking, a halfling is noticed in our group by Sturn. The hafling speaks up, "Do you need a guide?" John identifies the halfling as a "Kender", planar halfling. Barrow asks the halfling how long he's been here in Sigil. "Six cycles" A humorous exchange occcurs between the Kender and John as he tries to identify what a Cycle is. It comes down to about 300 days. The kender identifies himself as Babow. Barrow asks to know what's interesting around here that Babow could guide us to. Babow suggests the market. Barrow then asks about a job board. Babow tells us he got here from a cave, "right here" after being chased by a dragon. But he wasn't afraid. He's from Krynn. &nl;&nl;Babo tells us that there are 15 factions in town that do something for the benefit of the city. The Lady of Pain lets them run parts of the city for her. Like the Harmonium stop people from what they perceive as the law. They are very lawful people. They tend to not break deals. The transcendant order is a popular faction that almost everybody gets along with. Then there's the "Shousetechs" which are basically the devils advocate (Fraternity of the Order, Free League, Mercy Killers) for the devils advocates, they are very chaotic in nature. Babo notices Barrows large sword. "Maybe you'd like to talk to the Doomguard. They have all sorts of weapons and are basically the armory for the city.  Barrow, "What other factions?" Babo lists off a bunch. Babo also tells us that he knows where as portal is, but he's never been through and it doesn't know where it goes. Barrow asks about the Free League, Babo tells us that these individuals manage the markets. The Lady of Pain provides materials to the Free League, and they distribute out to the artisans. Barrow asks about the location of the Free Leagues office. Babo offers to guide us there. We follow him. &nl;&nl;Suddenly Babo runs past all of us brushing by Sturn. He grabs a bag off of some guy, then turns around and hands Sturn back a bag. "Here, that guy took this from you, OK, let's go" He takes us to the center of the market to a big round building. "At the center of every market is one of these", there is a sign stating "information". We watch Babo return a bottle of wine to a place after taking a swig and offering some to the rest of us. Babo then departs and says he's going back to "Wait for his people". &nl;&nl;We walk into the information building, in a hallway we see a board indicating "office". John knocks on the office door. We are greeted with "Come in!" from inside. We enter the office and see a human behind the counter. "What can we do for you?" John says something odd like "The shaou want job". Barrow iterates more clearly, "We're looking for employment" He asks "What kind of empoyment?" Me&colon; "I'd like to guard a forest please". "What's the toughest thing you've defeated?" a couple of us say "An imp" John says "Also a blood worm" Barrow adds "In the river of blood no less". Human, "Can you take three imps?" John "We've defeated a few tenari and some lemures" Human "GO in the hall, go down, third door on the left. Have a seat". We comply with his directions. &nl;&nl;Eventually a guy walks in "YOu the four looking for work?" some nods of ascent. "We want you to bring us Lightbringer" John "What's a lightbringer?" "It's a sword. Timmen doesn't need it anymore" We can supply you with rations if you can leave today. We supply you witha  rose dipped in honey, you go to the hive... " he explains what a hive is after some looks and confusing questions. "You turn left at the roaring baelor, make sure you don't rattle any bone boxes too loud as you're going through here. The people nearby have sharp ears. In the bailey past the baelor, find a door on the right down the alley. Whoever is holding the rose has to step through first, this will activate the portal to Timmens maze. Once you're inside, search until you find Lightbringer, the head courtyard in the center of the maze. Getting out is the trick. Do exactly as I say "Frmo the courtyard, exit on the ladies right hand. Go as far as you can, staying along the wall to your right. Once you hit a blind, no matter how small, look for a secrete door and you're out. Of course you have to have a key, it's a dish. They just appear out of no where holding food for Timlen. They should stay where they are left whether they are eaten or not." "What or who is Timlen", "HE's just a man, human, likes swords."  "The cutter out front will point you in the direction of the hive. He'll provide you with supplies if you need any." "IT pays handsomely" We get to keep what we find, we'll be paid handsomely. Lightbringer will be the only glowing sword. &nl;&nl;We exit and go and find Tim. I ask Tim who we're working for. He confirms that we are working for the Free League, He provides me with 5 days rations for both myself and Willow. He takes us to a supply warehouse where he hands out what we ask for. Others request rations as well. We request other things. I receive 2 water skins. We receive a couple continual light torches. Barrow and I both receive one. I request some paper for (10) for keeping notes. I ask for a chain shirt. They deliver all of the many items that are asked for. &nl;&nl;Tim then takes us out and points us toward the hive. "Oh, one more thing, you've got the rose? Here, put it in this" and he hands John a box to put the rose into. Tim provides us directions to get to the hive. We follow Tim. Tim estimates that we should arrive at the Hive by "peak", we estimate this to be about mid-day. &nl;&nl;About a half-hour away from the market, we come around a corner and John bumps into a female Tiefling. "Hey, I was looking for you guys" "What for?" John offers his hand, "Oh, no no no, I don't touch strange people" "Just go home, go somewhere else, give me the rose" John "How do you know abotu the rose?" "Doesn't matter, just give it to me and go on about your day" "So, the easy way or the hard way?" John "What's the easy way?" She says "The easy way", we are then surrounded by a group of &lbracket;enemies&rbracket;. &nl;&nl;&lbracket;COMBAT&rbracket;&nl;&nl;We beat all of the combatants off, but the woman tiefling drank a potion (CSW) feigning an attempt to yield for mercy. Battleaxe and belt pouch grabbed by me and battleaxe, battleaxe (she has shield, sword, chain shirt). After about half a minute we hear the distinct sounds of a group tramping in our general direction. We take this opportunity to exit the area. It appears that we were noticed, but not by the individuals sent to investigate. We get the the gatehouse before the Hive and find an inn nearby. John notices that we are followed in by a pair of individuals. We approach the innkeep and request rooms. He tells us that there are two room. We take both rooms B2, and B4. I ask for a meal and a bath. They do not have a bath. I order a standard meal for 2sp. (Each belt pouch has 2.5 gp 2 gold, and 1 "crystal" coin worth 25 gp appraised by Storn, they say 25 crowns on the coin). We set out all of the weapons and I cast detect magic. None of them display any magic. I create 7 good berries with the berries I have left. (Light Steel Shield with symbol). We clean up a bit and just hang out. We then retire downstairs for supper. I make the suggestion that we each take a pouch and save the fifth one as party funds to be used for things such as inn rooms. &nl;&nl;As we're eating supper, a lady in S&amp;M gear walks into the bar, she's carrying a whip with nine lashes on it. Barrow recognizes the woman as a priestess of Leviatar, mistress of pain. I believe her to be the lady of pain before Barrow informs the rest of us. She walks into the inn and proceeds down to the hall probably into a room. A Thri-Kreen is preening us with a flute and lute. (1 berry to John, I eat through 3 berries after healing minor for both myself and Barrow)&nl;&nl;There is a knock in the middle of the night to John and Storns room. "Let me in", after some knocking and waking of folks, the knocking stops. John opens the door and sees the priestess walking away. "Oh good, you're there", she tries to (non-magically) seduce John to come with her and tithe to Laviatar. John declines, and she leaves. The remainder of the night is uneventful. We go downstairs and get a hotmeal. &nl;&nl;We begin our trek into Timmens Maze. And pass the gatehouse into the Hive. &nl;&nl;
CHRONICLEENTRY:N:|CAMPAIGN:Craig's Game|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:10/5/13|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:Craig|CHRONICLE:As we are milling about in the Hive, Jon and Barrow tell everyone that we've been noticed. We start walking into the Hive and find the Roaring Baelor Inn. We enter the alley way, as instructed and are met by three individuals liking for Jacamapho pheno. He repeats "icoh icoh". We appear to be having a communication breakdown. The group appears to be human. I step around and attempt to speak to on that looks to be potentially druidic, but the results are the same. John shakes the hand of one of them and immediately is unable to speak to the rest of us. Through discussions, we discover that this is a curse passed through willing handshakes. This causes people that do not share the curse to be unable to communicate with you. John decides to walk into the Roaring Baelor Inn to try to find a patsy to pass the curse off to. As soon as we walk into the Inn, a giant Baelor head shouts out "CURSED ONE" (to which we all understand) and a light is shined upon John. John takes this diversion to immediately remove himself from the Inn. Johns journey leads him back out of the Hive. We all assume he is attempting to remove the curse. &nl;&nl;As we are approaching the exit to the Hive, a person comes running up behind us yelling "Wait!" The person offers to take the curse away from John, but it would cost him a small part of his soul. I inform the individual that he's passed on deals like this before. The person offers his hand to John and says "We'll see". John looks to each of us who are all shaking our heads. We continue our journey and John enters another Inn. John tries drawing to get to an infirmary, and draws the symbol of Correllan. We think he is looking for a church. We follow a gentleman into the Inn, thinking of asking the innkeeper about a nearby temple. Barrow asks the Innkeep if there are any "good" temples nearby. He tells us that they are about a half day away. And the closest is a temple to Leviatar. He tells us that the guys over at St. Cuthbert are good. They might help you out. He says they are about an hour away. He asks if we have any problem with celestials or holy ground? All the ground around the churches are hallowed. We ask for directions to the St. Cuthbert church and head out. &nl;&nl;We get to the church of St. Cuthbert and are greeted by some guards. One is a winged figure wearing a shiny breastplate and carrying a heavy mace. We talk a bit with the guard and inform him that our friend is cursed and we'd like to get it lifted. The guard welcomes us into the church. We are approached by an acolyte, we tell him our plight and request his assistance in removal of the curse. He tells us that there is no magic that will remove this curse. Any attempt to remove with those spells will only cause the problem to go away for a day. The only way to get rid of it is to pass it on to someone else or leave this plane and have a remove curse cast. While we are in Sigil, there is no way to get rid of it except to pass it on. This problem has been persisting for a couple of months now. Barrow draws out a picture to try to explain to John that he can get healed for 1 day for 150gp. John seems to understand. John tries to suggest something with an hour glass drawing, but we cannot quite understand what he wants. The acolyte things that he wants an hourglass, so he brings one out for 5gp. I grudgingly reach out my hand and shake his hand. John then hears for himself what the issue was and discusses what he wants. John reaches his hand out to accept back the curse, which I happily hand to him. Another man walks in and requests healing. The rest of us apparently hear the curse. He asks John to tell the priest that he found a portal that can take us off, about three hours, and we can go through and it will be about an hour return trip. He wants to take a priest with him and get it removed. Sturn and John shake hands and John relays the information to the priest. He offers to John that we can go with him and get healed as well, but we'd need an Onyx per person to go through. We exchange some information and find out that this would go to the astral plane. John decides the risk is not worth the effort. &nl;&nl;We follow John as he heads toward some unknown bar to rid himself of this nuisance. We proceed into a bar inside the Hive, not the Roaring Baelor. The singers on the stage are singing "Ico Ico" John offers up a drink to some alcoholic and shakes his hand. John asks the bartender if he knows of any cheap pickpockets.  As we're talking the the mistrels continue to sing, they come to a crescendo and a wash of magic washes over everyone. The group immediately disappears and a number of people are now also afflicted with the curse, including me. A guy walks in and offers 250gp to take the curse. He pays John 25gp to talk about to the bar. A satyr accepts the deal and skips off with the curse. &nl;&nl;We later find a beholder floats by. We also see a devil, John walks up to the devil, bows, and offers to shake his hand. The devil says "rabble rabble rabble (What do you want?)" After John walks away, the devil comes up to us and asks us what our friend wants. We tell him we don't really know. Sturn rabbles off something. The devil says "So, a dummy and a drunk?" John begins to run away as quickly as he can. We guess that John got feared or something. We chase after him for about a minute. We get back to the alley where there is a drow with two swords. The drow hands John a scroll. The scroll says that the clerics of St. Cuthbert sent him to take the curse from him. He has taken a vow of silence and has offered to take the curse from us. Barrow whistles to catch the drow and asks to see the scroll. He scribbles some ifnormation abotu the origin of the curse and tries to explain to the drow to return the item to the St. Cuthbert clerics. He seems to understand and changes course to walk towards teh correct direction.&nl;&nl;We continue our adventure and head into the door we expect and are met by some devils inside. &lbracket;COMBAT&rbracket; We start our combat and are greeted with one. After Barrow steps through a gold shimmering sheen covers the doorway. One of the devils steps through, and attacks me. He then steps backwards into the portal. A lemure steps up in his place and attacks Sturn. Willow and I dispatch the lemure and follow Barrow through the portal. John and Sturn soon follow. We're fighting a bearded devil. We defeat the devil, but find ourselves a bit exhausted. &nl;&nl;I begin sketching out our little room and label this as our starting point. We decide that we'll stay here as a defensible position and rest up to regain our spells. After combat, we notice that there is a metal bowl in the room that we arrived in. As John was scouting, he noticed a mark on the wall that he couldn't understand. After removing his curse he sees it is a checkmark. We're discussing our next move when John gets up and walks away without a word. We discuss it trying to figure out what he's doing, but nobody has any good idea. We decide to follow him, to see what he's up to. We scout around a bit, drawing as we go and we find a door with a pull ring. John tries to push the door, then pulls it open. &nl;&nl;We come upon a large room, about 80 feet in diameter with four doors in it. We see a carved statue in the center of the room of a twenty five foot woman with her arms spread facing the door we entered, the ceiling is about 50 feet up. Both of her outstretched arms point towards doors. The statue is far from flawless, chunks of stone are scattering the floor. Barrow notices that some of the marble chip pieces are chipped off of the base and some of them are scooting closer to the statue. We talk it over and decide that this is not the place for us right now. I suggest John closes the door. Willow and Barrow hear something, Willow turns and begins to growl back the way we came. We decide to investigate. John sneaks around and they come upon each other around a corner. Turns to be members of The Harmonium. THe leader demands Lightbringer. John tells him he doesn't have him/it. The leader says to get out of the way. John follows them briefly before returning to the group. After our brief encounter we decide to keep looking for a defensible place to rest. WIth the Harmonium here, we feel that the entrance is not really that safe anymore. I had an epiphany that the statue was a the lady in the courtyard. Scouting around we find another very large room. 50x70 feet at the longest and widest points. There are two additional doors exiting the room. In the room we see a small sleeping pallet, a blanket, a change of clothes and a jug of water. John spots a longsword under the bed with the carving "lightbringer" on it. It does have a faint glow to it. We take the sword, place it in John's sword sheath and head back towards what we believe to be the exit. We are met with a group we do not recognize of 6 people. They say "Give us the light bringer" John replies "Who's Lightbringer?", the wizard in the back responds with a volley of two magic missiles &lbracket;COMBAT&rbracket;&nl;&nl;We successfully, though barely pull off the combat and beat the group back.&nl;&nl;&lbracket;Spend 5sp for food, 2 goodberries&rbracket;
CHRONICLEENTRY:N:|CAMPAIGN:Craig's Campaign|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:11/9/2013|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:The old man takes us to a dead end in the tunnel. He says "Welcome to Karsery" and motions towards the wall. Some conversation indicates that we need to be pushed by a dwarf to get into Karsery. He pushes all of us through the threshold and into Karsery. We emerge through an archway to find ourselves facing a rope bridge. Having no other options, we decide to traverse the rope bridge towards some buildings tucked into outcroppings on the otherside of the bridge. We also notice that we are no longer inside a cave, but instead have exiting the underground and find gray skies above us. Some dwarves approach John on the other side of the bridge and holler out to Storn. Barrow ties a grappling hook to a rope and throws it across. Storn came back across to assist us over the bridge. A brief scare with a couple of us falling and Willow and I turn back. After Storn helps Barrow the rest of the way over the bridge, he comes back to carry Willow and myself back over safely. Apparently the dwarves we betting on some of us falling or something, because groans and cheers were heard and coins exchanged hands.    &nl;&nl;"Welcome to Gaola" one of the dwarves says. John begins asking some questions to see if we can ascertain where Zerakuk might be found. We are soon directed towards the Mayor to get more information. John asks if the dwarf could take us to see the mayor. I ask  his name, and am told his name is "Maier". We are led back into the town, seems like it's a small town in population. We make our way into Tavern/Bar. John walks up to the bartender, a female dwarf. John asks to talk with he mayor. She retorts, "Would you like to buy a drink?". John pays for the drinks out of the group funds for 4sp and slips her an additional 4 sp. John asks some questions and discovered that they mayor owns the inn, he may be there. So we make our way to the inn. &nl;&nl;Once inside the inn. We see a person behind a bar and another person behind a desk writing. The deskman asks "Checking in? Here for a meal?" John asks to see the Mayor. We're encouraged to get a meal and the mayor would be out after a bit. We're brought out a tasty meat and potatoes meal. Shortly after finishing our meal, a dwarf comes out and beckons us into an office. Barrow drank my ale. John asks about Zerakuk. The mayor requests 25gp for this information. He tells us that a man he thinks might be Zerakuk came through town. And was followed by a man in an eyepatch who fell off the bridge. He says that Zerakuk left town out the main road. Barrow asks how long ago that this happened. The mayor tells us that he came through about a half a week ago. John nearly gets himself cold-cocked with a pickaxe talking out loud about this local population beign uneducated. &nl;&nl;We begin our trek out of town and come up to a very long rope bridge. It's being guarded by "The Watcher", a human or half-elf, after ascertaining that we won't burn down the bridge, she allows us to pass. Barrow asks her about Zerakuk and she says a dwarf came across a few days ago. The watcher cuts one of the support ropes. "Oh, by the way, there's a 10 gold per head toll. Send  one person, and only one person. Oh, and my friends won't shoot you". I think she's bluffing about her friends, but everyone else disagrees. John heads towards her, intent to pay her the 40 gold. Storn starts heading out, she cries out "Stop moving!" and continues sawing at one of the supports. John tosses her 4 platinum. After he sprints off she puts her sword away and begins repairing the bridge. Barrow and I pay off our share of the toll. &nl;&nl;We walk up a hill, over a mound. A bit ahead of us, we see a fork in the road. At this fork is a hill giant, looking slightly confused about what she might be doing. She is definitely aware of our presence as her stance slightly changes. Barrow is apparently a bit noisy. We are about 30 feet away. Barrow bellows out "Greetings" in giant. She drops her club and responds, "I only look for Grolantor, no fight, not fight. You help me, I help you" in giant. "Do you speak common?" she responds with yes. "You help me, I help you?" Barrow and John understand Grolantor to be a God of the giants. She indicates that the branch to the right and says that goes off to her town. As luck would have it, I pointed the correct direction that would not lead to her town or back the way we came. Barrow asks for her name, she responds "Tanaka". She asks "Does anyone have any food?" &nl;&nl;We continue down the path for a couple of hours, coming to yet another fork in the road. No knife or spoon. Tanaka comes to the fork and begins scratching her head, looking between the two paths. We arbitrarily decide to continue down the left fork. Our general path is taking us north. We break off the road and find a semi-defensible position up against a rock wall to camp out for the night. The night progresses uneventfully. After a couple of hours walking along the path, the wind begins to really howl. We come around a bend and find a cave, which appears to be the source of the howling. Other sounds emanating are screams, laughing and cursing. I ask "We're going to have to go in there, aren't we?" Approaching the cave, we find ourselves on a shear rock bridge. Closer yet, we find splintered bones around the area in the ground. Most of these bones resemble animal bones with the occasional humanoid bone mixed in. As John begins scouting, he gets about halfway across the landbridge when the sounds in the cave go silent. "Who's there?" is called out from the cave by some generally female voice. John asks "And who might you be?" A wolf-headed humanoid comes partially out of the shadows of the cave. She asks "What do you want?", John says "We're looking to find a person by the name of Zerakuk". "I don't know any Zerakuk" "Do you know a brightmantle? Or of a dwarf?" "I am tired and do not want to hunt" Tanaka yells out "Goodberry!" John pulls out a trail ration and proffers it to her. She requests two more rations and healing and she will give her information about where she last saw a dwarf. Barrow requests two berries before heading out to meet up with her. She appears to be gaunt and starved. She comes out a little bit to meet with Barrow and John. John says "Now it's time to do that thing" she asks "What thing?" "Just something to ensure you will keep to your bargain". John apparently has aggravated her and set her on edge. "It's just another way to inspect you". Barrow casts Detect evil, he identifies this dog thing as evil, but our giant companion does not emanate evil. Barrow decides that healing this creature up fully for additional information is not in our best interest. We head back to the fork in the road.&nl;&nl;We start our trip out and come to another fork. We take the north fork. The giant continues to eat up our goodberries. We climb up a ledge, around a bend and find another rope bridge. Two hundred foot bridge across a chasm. On the opposite edge of the bridge, near some outcroppings is a village. A sentry on the other side of the bridge starts yelling "TO ARMS!""Leave your weapons and you can cross. And leave the hill giant behind!" Barrow says "Tanaka, I think you'll need to stay here." John leaves his weapons with the group and goes across. We ask Storn to go, he refuses. I'm fed up with that retort, call him and idiot and head across so that John isn't left alone. &nl;&nl;The villagers ask us who we are. John says "I'm John Smith." They ask me. "Aiven". "What do you want? Where are you going?" John tells them. "I ask about anyone coming through in the past few days" They indicate that no, no one has come through in the past few days. "Do you need any supplies?"  I ask to go back to the group. Tanaka asks about Grolantor. They refuse to trade with us with our weapons. John returns back across the bridge to ask after Grolantar. The villagers inform him about a shrine nearby that has a giant man leader or something that leads them. He's supposed to be huge. They tell him to talk to Bob, he's been there in order to get directions to wheret his place is at. Go back the way you came, you'll come to a fork, go left. You'll go over a bridge and come to a fork. Go left. You may come to one more bridge, and you'll be there. &nl;&nl;We head back the way we came and before we get to the fork in the road we come upon a group of dwarves. They immediately take a defensive stance shouting "Kill it!" referring to Tanaka. They identify the village that we just left as "Strafling", which is where they are headed to. I ask to trade for some berries. They sell us 3 berries for 1 silver. They allow us to pass them. Barrow and John buy a silver worth of salt off of them. We follow Bob's directions for the rest of the day uneventfully after the dwarves. &nl;&nl;We follow the path, heading upwards. Finding places that look like the walls were cut out of the rock. We come around the bend to find a building. We look like we're on more of a worked road at this point, and a few minutes away from the building. The building looked much closer than we thought due to its enormous size. It takes us about 30 minutes to get to the building. The proportions of the building structure seem to indicate something two or three times higher than an average hill giant. The building is between a couple of peaks that dwarf this building. We come to a staircase leading up to and into the building. The building appears like it could be a temple. The stairs are 6 foot tall. To the side, we see some two foot medium man size steps. There do not appear to be any symbols that stand out. We get up to the doorway and see symbols indicating we're in Karsery. Karsery has 6 layers, Barrow figures we're on the 4th layer based on what we've seen so far. It's also called the Tarterian Depths, Tartarus and the Red Prison. Home to deities such as Vaeron, Malar, Talona the lady of poison, and several Titans, the demon lord Grazath, said to be a lich. And the demon lord Occipitous. It is also rumored that the god of the Naga's resides here. We, the insignificant gnats, go forward into the temple. We are greeted by five armored and armed humans. In addition there are three robed men nearby. One of them says "What have you come for?" John says "We are looking for the fabled one named Zerakuk". They respond "We'll take you to him", Tanak says "No, I'm looking for Grolantor." "Oh, you won't find Grolantor here. You'll find something much more powerful. The titan god Creus." I flip Tanaka a goodberry and wish her luck. &nl;&nl;We are escorted through the very large halls and a few doors. The doors seem to open with a bit of ease comparative to their size. They take us to a door and say "He's right in here". We see a very large room (80x200). "He's down at this end" and they point into the room and leave, shutting the door behind us. We hear some latching mechanism engage. As we walk the room seems to light up. We see a dwarf locked in a marble birdcage hanging from the ceiling. John asks "Are you the fabled Zerakuk?" "Fabled, what're you g... who are you?" John, "We are friends of Blom" "So you guys go trapped here, same as me?" "yeah" "Well, welcome to prison." John relays the message to Zerakuk from Blom. Zerakuk asks if any of us have any lockpicks. John tosses a rope up to Zerakuk to try to climb up and unlock the birdcage. John is successful in opening the cage. Zerakuk asks to be lowered down. Claiming that he doesn't climb so well, he spent all of his time in books. John lowers down Zerakuk then jumps down out of the birdcage. &nl;&nl;removed&nl;&lbracket;-1 pp&rbracket;&nl;&lbracket;-2 goodberry&rbracket;
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:11/23/2013|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:The dwarf apparently has no exit strategy, unless we can get him out of this room. We begin searching the room trying to find some mechanism in order to open the door. Our search comes up empty. After a time bowls of porridge appear in front of all of us. With nothing else we're able to do, we eat up and pass the time. After a couple of days and lots of pushing on the door an ogre opens the door. He says to us in common "I'll let you go if you take me with you." We start talking to the dwarf about how we would get home. We find it is through a portal, but the key required to use the portal is to sacrifice a pinky finger in order to open the door. He says "Unless you guys know of the natural key". He explains a little bit about that, Barrow begins quickly jotting down notes. The ogre identifies himself as Kersh. We ask about where the portal will take us. The dwarf doesn't know, he just knows it leaves this plane. Kersh says we should leave soon, then follows that up with "If we get seen, we're not together." Some conversation ensues about the logistics of keeping up the charade. &nl;&nl;We head out of the room and look towards a door to the left. We open the door and find lots of busts of various creatures. The room looks to be filled with lots of pieces of artwork. Storn feels like the artwork in this room is very intricate and the artist had an eye for details. Our group estimates the value of the artwork to be valued between 10k and 25k. The ogre speaks up indicating his disapproval of Storn taking any items. We decide to continue looking through rooms and head towards the direction we think to be the entryway, and to the closest next door. John opens the next door. Inside we see a large open room, similar to the one that we came in through. Immediately inside the door John sees the back of a guard. The guard appears to not have noticed us, John slowly and quietly closes the door. We turn around, head back past the room we were trapped in and go down the hallway to the next door. We come around the corner and find an extremely long hallway with doors at indeterminate intervals on each side of the hallway. We open the door closest to us. We find a storeroom on the other side of the door. I notice four chips of marble on the floor, the ogre and I pick a piece up. Barrow and the dwarf think that these pieces of marble may be keys to the portal. And that this room is the portal. Storn, John, Barrow and the dwarf all reach down to pick up the remaining two pieces. John and Storn make the grabs. John hands off the marble to Barrow. Barrow activates the door, and Storn runs through the door. The portal disappears. We find guards yelling at us and quickly i activate the door again and usher the dwarf through. He hands me the stone that the ogre passed off to him. The ogre then follows him through. The guards are now very close, I activate the door a third time, and walk through. John quickly follows behind. &nl;&nl;We all arrive in a city, it seems almost assuredly to be Sigil. John gets a necklace and puts it on. Some sort of odd trade. The stranger identifies us to be in the Lady's ward. Barrow asks about the date, but the stranger does not know much about it. After other asks we discover the location of the temple district. I look over to Kersh and say "Well, Kersh, you're free now." we counsel him to try not to get into trouble and caution against actions which would lead him into trouble. We lead Zerakuk on to our employers. &nl;&nl;Zerakuk asks us if he could give us anything in thanks for rescuing him. I ask about a portal to the prime material. He indicates he knows of one that is in Faerun, near the Dalelands, possibly the southern Dalelands. Barrow asks about the key. He says it is 1 pound of silver dust. Zerakuk indicates that this is a guarded secret. He says he'll show us as long as we can assure him that we won't share the information widely. He reminds us that this is a one-way portal. To whit I retort "Yeah, they all have been so far" Zerakuk leads us on a short detour as we approach the market. He takes us down an alley "Come on, I'll show you where the portal is real quick." He tells us that he has another portal to go down that he's been wanting to go down for a long time. However, he cannot share the details. "One of the reasons that this portal hasn't been found is that it is in the middle of an alley, unlike some of the portals which are in privvies, people enter the privvies and dont' come out. It becomes pretty obvious that is a portal." He shows us the opening mechanism for the portal and where we would pour the silver. "Once you pour the silver in and close that brick, it will port you to the Dalelands. This operates for one person. It will drop you behind a bar in a small city." &nl;&nl;We continue our journey off to the marketplace. As we enter our employer, they immediately recognize Zerakuk and rush him back. As we begin to follow they stop us and say "no no, you guys wait here". I yell out to Zerakuk "Good luck!", he yells back "You too!". A cashier comes out and offers up our pay, 200gp. They ask us if we're interested in more work. John divvies out the cash, 50gp each. We head back towards our temples and find an inn for us to stay at. Jorzans Inn. I ask about a room that would house four of us. I ask for a discount and offer 35gp for the week, he declines and instead offers 42gp for the week with breakfast included, or he can discount to 40gp. John hands over the funds to the room. The barkeep hands back a key. He then flips around a book "Sign the register" John signs in his native language, he asks "WHat's it say?" "John" "And your name?" "John Smith". "OK".  Supper is 1gp. &nl;&nl;As we're sitting around feasting upon our meal, a half-elf walks into the bar and walks up to us. "Look here I need a band of people that are not afraid to travel to Plaguemort and bring me back some razor vine." he drops a bag on the table in front of us. It jingles as only a purse full of money could. I say, "Plaguemort? That doesn't sound pleasant". Barrow asks "Why do you need razorvine from Plaguemort? Why can't you use the razor vine here?" John knows that Plaguemore has a portal to the abyss. Barrow knows that Plaguemort has a portal to the prime material and that there is a church of Ogma. Ogma is a neutrally aligned religion. It is a city that has about 50k people in it. "There is a bag of 100pp, and I will give each of you 200pp when you return. I am working on a spell that will limit the growth of the razorvine" Some discussion occurred around logistics of harvesting, getting there, etc. "I'm going to need it from the gateway portal to the abyss." We accept the job. "The portal you need is in the clerks ward. You'll need a clerk escort. The key to the portal there, and back, is a sprig of razor vine. There's some outside growing up the wall of this building. Make sure you activate the portal on the way back with a sprig that you did NOT collect for me. Razor vine dies when it is plucked, here is a special solution that will keep it alive. As soon as you cut off the sprig, immediately place it in this solution and cap it off. I understand Plaguemort is getting a little tense these days. So be carefule, if you get into an incident, you might push the town into the abyss. When you get back, the barkeep knows how to reach me." John "How do we get back?" Me&colon; "I assume the portal is two way?" "Yes". Barrow asks after his name, "Bachalis" &nl;&nl;We make our way to the elven temple. They admit me and allow me to do my prayers and pick some berries. They offer the group, after escorting them to the grove, a goodberry. After done there we make our way to Barrows temple. John buys 2 CLW potions for the group. The Plaguemort portal to prime material leads to Baldur's Gate. Barrow and I buy silver dust and diamond dust. We head to the clerks, we go out and get some sprigs of razor vine. We proceed through the portal. &nl;&nl;We find ourselves in Plaguemort. We find ourselves in a room with a floor covered in a 'stew of guts'. There are some skinned and some unskinned dead things hanging from hooks in the ceiling. There is a smell of dead animal permeating the air, flies are buzzing everywhere. In addition, we smell something sweet, possibly fruit. Barrow slips in the gore and finds himself a bit of a mess. We exit the room to find ourselves in a butcher shop that appears to be closed. We slowly make our way out of the butcher shop. Barrow wipes off the gore on an apron inside. We head out of the shop and find ourselves in a street. John describes the people walking by as a Mortai, a Cambian race of half tanari, half humanoid. We find that it is now mid-day, or that's what it appears to us.&nl;&nl;John walks up to the nearest Mortai and says "Hello good sir", he responds "Piss off" and keeps walking away. John shouts out to another walking by "Hey buddy!" "I ain't your buddy guy!" some bantering occurs. The Mortai draws his sword, "Problem?" Barrow notices a sign across the street indicating "Marks Magic Emporium", we jot that down in Barrow's little notebook. I begin walking off, looking for an inn. Storn asks where I'm headed, I say I'm looking for where we need to go. Short conversation ensues, the rest of the group starts off behind me. We come across an Inn, Eclavdra Inn (in common). We enter the Inn. There are some tanari, a half-elf and a couple of others, including drow. The bartender is a male drow and there are three drow patrons, one of them being female. John walks up to the half-elf "Can I buy you a drink?" "You better if you wanna talk". The rest of us go find a place to sit while John walks up to the bartender. He almost immediately asks about the gate to the abyss. The bartender forces him to buy a drink. The bartender offer the information of the abyss for 250gp. The half-elf he takes the drink to scoffs at the drink. John has clearly identified himself as not from around here. Storn steps outside of the inn. We order drinks and the drow look to be going to mess around with Storn. The rest of us get up and head out. As we get out, the drow appear to change their minds and head back inside. The encounter avoided. A priestess of Lloth comes walking by. John bows towards he. Upon noticing the large presence of evil individuals and a priestess of Lloth, Barrow and I decide it is appropriate to conceal our holy symbols for the time being. &nl;&nl;We keep walking through the town and come to what appears to be a public square. From there we see a section of town that appears to be walled off. While walking through the square we hear comments about oppressive rulers. In the center of the square is a man loudly complaining about the "hounds of plaguemort" and crying out against oppression. The walled off section appears like it may be a keep or castle. We are able to identify three arches into the castle area. One of them has some heavy duty razor vine growing on it. We decide to take some razor vine around an archway. As we're getting nearby, we are approached by a tiefling. Some conversation ensues, the tiefling indicates that the archlector owns this area. He offers us to get a permit to cut down the razor vine. Gaz is the name of the guard. Barrow asks for a recommendation of an Inn, the tiefling directs us to "Garzans Inn". As we're walking towards Garzan's inn, we notice 3 wyverns fly overhead with horned riders. We're assuming tanari or tiefling. &nl;&nl;We get to Garzan's Inn and walk in. We see the barkeep is a Tanari. John popped his head in, popped it out. Barrow pushes past him and walks into the Inn. John comes in with us and stands to the side of the door. Barrow and the rest of us walk up to the bar. Barrow talks to him and asks about rooms. We acquire two rooms, 23 and 29 for 10gp. When we wake it is night time. A murder and looting occurs out in the street. I counsel John to not just run out.&nl;&nl;The next morning we go back to the gate to meet with Gaz. "I got good news, I got it approved." I pay Gaz for 50gp for more to get extra sprigs. John takes the fee out of the group funds for everyone. We hear a couple of explosions, a couple guards get pulled into the crowd. General unrest seems to be occurring. We find ourselves cut off from our diety, a desecrate area. We take time to get over to the butcher shop. John is able to pick open the lock to the butcher shop. We find we cannot exit through the portal. We're postulating that it might be due to the desecration in the area. Nobody knows for sure. A kender comes in, runs face first into the wall with his razor vine sprig out. John helps him up. We decide that we'll wait things out in the butcher shop. We keep waiting in the butcher shop for up to a day. A half-elf lady comes in, "You're not gonna kill me, are you?" she hunkers down into a corner of the shop. A passerby in the streets yells "The arch-lector is dead! Killed by assassins that snuck away" We are able to piece together that the area is in a state of "limbo", until the balance tips in either direction, connections to dieties and the portals will be non-functional. We wait for two days in the butcher shop. After half a day, I begin to feel a connection to Meilkki return. The woman turns into a drow, her dagger turns into a staff and she slams it into the ground, summoning a drider and two large spiders. "Leave now, or I will feed you to my pets." We run into the back room and get through the portal. &nl;&nl;&lbracket;two lbs silver dust, -10gp, 1 lb diamond dust -25gp, -1pp, 1g, +100pp&rbracket;
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:Craig's Game|PARTY:|DATE:12/28/13|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:As we get into the Inn we meet our contact and collect our pay. We immediately make our way over to the temple of Corellen. As we are walking up to the place, John trips into an elf walking there as well. He knocks her down, in his attempt to help her up she brushes away his hand and gets herself up. I immediately notice this newcomer as a worshipper of Meilikki and jovially escort her into the temple and back to the grove. I offer her up a Goodberry. John and Sturn ask around about some magical items and end up purchasing a Healing Belt, John also purchases an Everlasting rations and Everfull mug. Barrow purchased himself some magical chain shirt. As my group is talking over what they wish to purchase, Bella and I have a discussion about why I am here. I invite Bella to join us at our Inn for a meal. I offer to buy her meal. A stranger walks up to Bella and offers to shake her hand. We all immediately yell out to NOT do that and explain the situation about the curse in Sigil. Bella purchases a bottle of Elven wine from the barkeep and I pay out 2gp for her and my meals. John pays off the meals for the remainder of the group. We talk about Barghests and our motives for keeping around. A group of performers come into the Inn and begin playing. They are a group of tieflings. John takes himself out of the building afraid to be cast upon again. The rest of us remain and I explain to Bella why John left. Bella decides to stay at the inn with us. We all part our ways and head up into our rooms to sleep. &nl;&nl;As we are eating breakfast, the Free Guild guy from the warehouse approaches us. "I've got a job for you guys, it pays 600gp, it should be easy, it's a one day gig. We need this noblemans kid babysat while he goes on a hunt." "The son is going hunting, he asked us to hire a group to guard him." Bella and I ask "What is he hunting? Where is he going?" "Whatever, in some woods, you have a Cabin that you'll go to and he'll hunt from there. He wants to go hunting, you go with him, guard him and he brings his kill back. Here's 100gp upfront, and 500gp when the mission has been completed. It's not hell at least, it's only the outlands." Me&colon; "Where do we meet him?" "Meet me at the warehouse in the market and I'll take you to the noblemans house. He wants to inspect the guarding party first. Come to the market by mid-day so we have enough time to get to the house" Barrow asks about where to find Armor crystals. "Come with me and I could help you find it. We might even have some of our own." We follow him to the warehouse where Barrow, John and Sturn do some shopping. He asks if we want coin or gems. We all get 2 gems worth 10gp each. &nl;&nl;He leads us on to the noblemans house. Derrick introduces us to the house man and departs to go back to work. The house man offers us a drink "The lord is not in, he should be back soon, Probably another hour or two" he leads us into a study to await the lord. John announces to the group that he'd like to be known as Xiao-now. No, not Xiao-now, just Xiao. After a couple of hours the lord walks in "So, you guys are going to protect my son." He pulls out a gem and starts looking us over after ensuring that each of us answered, with words his question. "Well, most of you are good. Have you eaten?" I say "I could eat again" "I will feed you again before you leave. You leave in about 4 hours, this will be a morning hunt. You will depart with my son, help him in his hunt, protect him, and help him bring back his kill." Some of us nap and/or rest. The rest of us keep a watch out. After a couple of hours we are served a meal. After about another hour after the meal, the nobleman walks in with his fop. "<sigh> Is this the help? I guess it'll do. Get off your lazy butts and come on" says the fop. We walk into a room with a couple of pillars upright. The fop pulls out a piece of deer antler and scratches some symbol on the side of the pillar. After he completes a draconic symbol for lodge, a shimmering portal appears and he walks through. We follow him and step out into a rustic "lavish" lodge. Bella asks "Sir... uh, should we just call you sir or do you have a name?" "I am Jennoth" Bella asks "If something were to happen to you, how would we get you back?" <sigh> "If that were to happen, however unlikely, bring me back to Jeeves and he will take care of it. You are here to protect me though." Bella "So, Jennoth, is there a particular thing that you are hunting for? Or just something you come across?" "Something big. Let's go out, just come on." There are two guys outside with two horses each. They hand each of us a horse and they offer a quiver of Javelins to everyone. As soon as everyone is mounted Jennoth yells out "Hi-yah!" and takes off in a bolt.  He yells out "Ooh, flashes of light!" and he bolts off. &nl;&nl;As he stands up in his saddle and hucks a javelin, we also see a quick glimpse of white. He then rides up and dismounts. He took down a white heart with an enormous rack. After the fop kills it, the stag begins to glow brightly, we're all blinded. After the glow disappears, we find ourselves teleported to a new place. We are no longer in the forrest, instead we find ourselves in a savannah. Jennoth begins wimpering uncontrollably upon being teleported. He stands up and demands "Where are we? I demand to know where we are and what happened?" Barrow, Bella and John guess us to be somewhere in the Beastlands. Jennoth begins walking towards the low lands. "Take my kill" John suggests us to go towards the river. Jennoth says "No, I think I see a structure that way, so that's where we are headed." Some argument occurs in regards to dragging the kill along with us and leaving it here so that we may protect the fop. The fop attacks Barrow who is standing on the heart preventing Jennoth from taking it. His argument is that taking the heart is in direct conflict to our attempt to protect him. A skirmish between the group and Jennoth occurs. After the scuffle is done, and threats are made, Jennoth says "fine, my dad is going to be PISSED!" abd he yells out "HOMEBOUND!" and poof, he's gone with his hart. Bella and I both were able to identify that he cast Word of Recall. &nl;&nl;We begin following the path north around the foothills to try to find a way home. We hear howling coming from behind us and suspect that something is coming for us. The sounds appear to be coming from the way we came. We begin hustling around the direction we were originally headed. Aware that we are probably now being tracked. By the time we reach the river, we have confirmed that we are being followed and will soon be overtaken. The river is icy cold. It will be uncomfortable to go for a swim in this water and this air. Trying to cross the river, most of us fell in. Even though we found a nice shallow path at a ford area. Willow slipped off the rocks and I fell into the river. I struggled to keep myself afloat and Xiao was able to come and save me. Barrow estimates that the pack following us is about 15 minutes away. We see some standing stones up on the mountain from this side of the river. &nl;&nl;Bella makes an attempt to hide our trail as we move along for about 5 minutes. As we hustle along, we come upon a scrab of scrub brush which we will not be able to run through. We spot a flock of large birds coming up from behind us where the dust brush is. We escape into the brush and we see that the birds are very close, medium sized hawks. We find a path and begin heading up. The hawks are heading our direction. We make a break to run up to the standing stones and are attacked by the group of hawks. We reach the standing stones and find a large stone slab at the center of the circle. Grain and wine offerings are at this altar. There appears to be three layers of stones in a circular pattern. Barrow deduces that we may need an offering of grand and/or win in order to get through. We then hear more howling and yipping followed by a hunting horn. Bella cleans off the grain and gives me the idea to try to purify the food on the altar, maybe that will activate the portal. Nothing seems to happen and we find ourselves surrounded by the hounds. Combat!! Antlered Man. &nl;&nl;The huntsman blows his horn and the animals all back off "It's not fun being the hunted, is it?" "You can leave now" And a portal opens up. We step out into Sigil. &nl;&nl;
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:Craig's Game|PARTY:|DATE:1/25/2014|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:Bellock is looking around for some guards and sees three guards escorting a Barbazu. He walks up to an elf he sees walking by "Excuse me?" "Yes, Fine sir", pleasantries are exchanged. "What quarter of town are we in?" "You're in the hive ward." "Bellock" "Jeb". "What brings you to the Hive ward Jeb?" I ask him where if he knows the way to the Bellowing Balor. He points and says "This way!" Jeb asks us about where we came from and Bellock explains a little bit about our little adventure with the Huntsman. Jeb leaves us entering the temple of Garl Glittergold just outside of the Hive ward. We decide to continue along to our inn. Bellock joins us at the inn. We heal up anyone that's injured and turn in for the night, which passes uneventfully.&nl;&nl;In the morning we all head down and have our breakfast. As we're Tim, from the Free guild, walks up to the table. "Thought you guys would be here. Yeah, you're not getting paid." I announce that I need to tend to some plants at the temple of Correllan. Bellock offers to join me. As we're walking down the street Storn is nearly rolled over by a bearded devil. We notice some harmonium guards making chase and Bellock takes off in pursuit. The bearded devil turns off down the alley next to the Temple of Chondakal. The bearded devil pulls out a human skull, draws a star pattern in the air and smashes the skull on the side of the temple. A portal opens up and he steps through. The portal remains open for about 20 seconds before disappearing. The guards say, "Welp, that's out of our jurisdiction" and the guards walk off. Barrow walks into the church and steps into an office and explains the portal that the temple clergy did not yet know about. I let everyone know that I'm heading across the street to tend to my plants while they investigate this new portal. &nl;&nl;After I complete my tending we head back over to the church of Chondakal. The church offers if we want to go scout out the portal. They offer 500gp for the task and up to a weeks worth of food and water. 6 water skins, 35 days of rations, (3 to Storn, 10 to Barrow, 8 John, 7 Bellock, 7 Aiven). I provide 100pp to purchase a scroll of plane shift so that we can get back. 8 of the church show up and they're all ready to get stuff ready for departing. "WHo wants to do the honors?" Storn jumps up quickly "I'll do it!" They hand a scroll to Barrow with Analyze Portal and tell him to cast that. They give Barrow 250gp as half-payment for the task.  Barrow is able to identify that the portal goes to abyss, the key back is a betazu skull and is used in the same fashion as the human skull on this side. We all step through into the Abyss.&nl;&nl;As we step out into the Abyss we are surrounded by Webs. Willow is instantly stuck. Bellock groans, "ah crap". He tells us we're in the Demon web pits, home of Llolth, 66th level of the abyss." Turning around we see a wall behind us and the webs extend at least 60 feet. We're trying to walk through the webs to head towards an opening in this cavern place. As we're slowing making our way through, we have identified that there is a group that is approaching us. The creatures shoot an arrow at us. John, Willow and Aiven all fall asleep during combat through poisons. Barrow and Bellock try to get the Planeshift scroll out and get us out of a horrible situation. Unfortunately, the spell dissipates into nothing and we're stuck in the abyss. Drider shows up and distracts the drow for a time. Barrow is able to singlehandedly dispatch two of the drow archers and is harrassing the cleric. The drow captain is soon finding himself fighting off a drider with help from the last archer left. The captain and the remaining archer dispatches the drider. After taking out the cleric, the captain retaliates and quickly drops Barrow.&nl;&nl;The drow tie us all up. And one of them leaves. A day later a cart arrives and we're all loaded up onto the cart. All of our things are removed. We're taken to a city and we're put into a prison. We're not given food, but we do receive a bit of drink. On day 9, the planeshift goes off. We appear in front of the church of Condakal, all of our items and our barely concious people appear, naked. &nl;&nl;Subtract 100pp, 2 action point, &nl;Add 7 rations, 2 water skins
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:3/1/2014|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:Recovering from Xiao's fight in the arena.&nl;&nl;We make our way across Sigil to get to the Chuch of Mystra. Xiao and Sturn are looking for magical items. Xiao asks for his items. The priestess that greets us indicates that she needs to have a "look over". Xiao allows the spell to be cast. And then a second. "What will these items be for?" she asks. Xiao responds "For my work", "What is this work?" "Mercenary". After casting the spells he is offered the bastard sword he is interested in for 2500 gold pieces. Sturn goes through the same exercise that Xiao did interested in finding a magical axe and everfull mug. I ask for a backpack or extra dimensional space in order to carry something. I ask to try it on first. She hands me a backpack that is a little large for me, she says it will be 2300gp. She says "Say Fit Me". I say "fit me". And the backpack magically reduces to my size. "That's fantastic, I'll take it". Xiao pays her in gems and I hand her an additional 5pp. Barrow closes our transaction looking for a Vest of Resistance. 1200gp. Xiao exchanged 500gp for 1 500 gp black pearl and he donates 75gp to Mystra. She brings out the Vest for Barrow and indicates that it is a shiftweave dress. It can be changed to rags, church dress, fancy, fancy dress something else. Xiao comes up with yet another item to bother this woman with. He asks for some ring for protection, around 2000. She offers a Ring of Protection for 2500gp. &nl;&nl;We find our way to a smithy nearby. We find one that is run by a deep gnome. Storn sells off his dwarven war axe, Xiao sold off a bastard sword, and Barrow is trying to purchase a BAS (Big Ass Sword). Xiao purchases 4 silver daggers, upon the suggestion that there be lycanthropes in them thar woods. We walk for about 10 minutes looking for an inn. I regale the group on the wonders of Meilikki during this time. &nl;&nl;Upon finding an inn we find quite a bit of activity in the inn. Various merchants of all sorts of races and creeds. This seems like a place that could be welcoming to all sorts. One thing to notice is a planatar seated across from a tenauri having some conversation. We get room 2B. The room is very busy. It takes some time to get to talk to the barkeeper for the room. The inn is called The Ubiquotious Wayfarer. &nl;&nl;We hear a voice in our heads "I think that's my bottle of wine, please bring it over here." We determine that the source is a "naga" looking creature. Xiao and Barrow thing that this might be a tenauri. Xiao takes the wine to her. She nods towards the table as he approaches. He nods politey, sets down the bottle of wine and turns to head back to our table. The maid brings us a pitcher of ale. "Who bought that?" asks Barrow. "That guy" and she points to the solar. He nods towards us with a smile. &nl;&nl;After a while, the barmaid brings us our "change". There is some gold, electrum and an oddly shaped coin. We make a failed attempt to get her attention to return the coins. She is oblivious to our request. We notice a couple of githyanki that are leaving. A couple of imps stagger away from the table. The drunk imps soon come up to our table. The githyanki come up and begin clapping as the imps dance some jig. When we all denied initially the imps started to become offended. Barrow, Xiao made sure to step up and start dancing. After a waitress comes up and pours us a shot of rye, Storn also steps up and begins dancing. One of the imps leans in and tells us that he is supposed to deliver this bag of Sweet fire something or other to Betazu Zimmamar. When you burn them the smell like a sweet summer day. We gotta go. The githyanki poof out and the imps stagger out the door, one attempting to make a short flight. I estimate the bag to be worth about 50gp. After a pretty eventful evening, which turns out to be slightly profitable, we retire up to our room.  &nl;&nl;As we walk into our room, we're surrounded by a golden glow. We step through and find ourselves looking at an inn. We find ourselves in a large crowded room. high ceilings and stone arches leading to connecting chambers. Tables chairs and stools are crowded with bashers. We imagine that every evil eye is already fixed upon us. Most of the creatures here are tenauri. We notice humans and other races, but each seems just as evil as the tenauri next to them. We look behind us to get bumped into by a huge orantatun looking creature. We are in a doorway into this new area. &nl;&nl;I ask for a room interrupting Xiao asking for a way back to Sigil. I inform the barkeep he's had a couple of drinks, we just need a room. He says sure, we got a room. All in the name of the blood War. A large clawed behemoth ugly mean looking thing walks up and talks. He asks in some unintelligible language, then again "OK, let's try common then. Who are you? What Lord protects you?" Xiao responds "zimmamar" he says "nope, that's not good enough." he snaps his fingers and beckons a couple  more of his kind. We hear in common "Help me! Help!" from a human running in through an archway. "It's after me!" The human is disheveled, dirty and covered in cuts and blood. Pushing in behind him is a huge mishapen spider. "OK, who let the bebaleth in here?" As the guy falls to the ground, a bright glow emerges from him, cutting through the shadows of the hall, sending all the tenauri cowering away, except for one. This one moves closer to the glow. "No, that is mine" calls out the Vrock. The Vrock shifts into some angelic looking creature, charges into the bebalith. We hear a bellow "blah blah. Blah blah in the abyss." &nl;&nl;After some combat, the bebaleth and the Diva tangle. The Diva bellows out "Mortals, help me and I will take you with me" and mumbles something about a message to his master. More combat ensues and the bebaleth casts a spell and disappears. The divan then emits a light and points to an archway and says "Go through there!", we walk through and a gray mist forms around us. We come out in a bath house. After we exit, the diva says "I regret to inform you that I will require your assitance for a bit longer. You will be greatly rewarded. My name is Ydil. My power sent me to the abyss to identify a tanauri plot. I voluntarily and temporarily set my spark." Lots of story about the bebalith and Ydils powers and his story. "I need you to retrieve my spark from the babalith. I grow weaker by the moment. If you can get me to principality... " he goes unconcious. Barrow and I look over a wound that didn't heal. We discover that he's poisoned and in a coma. &nl;&nl;As we leave the bath house we are met by an attendant. Xiao asks "Are we in Sigil?" "Yes, you are in the Guild hall ward", John asks "Which way to the Ladies district." He points towards a wall. We drag Ydil along with us as we begin a trek towards the Ladies district, keeping eyes out for a church. We run across a temple of Tymora and take Ydil in there to see if we can get him helped.  We walk in and I ask for help healing our friend whom has been poisoned. "So you need a neutralize poison?" "Yes, please." He says "Gimme a moment to find our cleric, that service will be 280 gold pieces." The cleric comes out and casts neutralize poison on Ydil. &nl;&nl;&lbracket;-1 action, should have 7&rbracket;
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:3/22/2014|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:We begin making our way towards Temple of Correllan to get aid for Ydil. As we're walking I notice a guy observing us and then running off. After a couple hours of our trip, a man in Full Plate, with a symbol of the Transcendant Order. Barrow says "Well met" The individual lifts her visor. "Well met, I am Quickari of the Transcendant Order. We are interested in helping your friend." I ask "Helping him how?" "At the great gymnasium we have powerful healers. We should take him there." Me, "How far are is this great gymnasium?" "We can be there in less than an hour." Barrow&colon; "How did you come to know that we were here?" "We have been watching for the Diva's return. He was on a mission for the city and it is important. We want to ensure that it is properly received for the city and not imbalanced for one faction." Me, "We had the healers of Tymora remove the poison, but it had no effect."  We begin our walk to this gymnasium. Quickari is inspecting Ydil as we walk. Barrow asks her if she is a healer. "Of a sorts." "I'm a warrior to Sylvanus." Barrow tells her "He has other issues that healing will not resolve." I say "It's probably not an appropriate discussion to have in the middle of the street." &nl;&nl;As we approach the gymnasium we notice several guards out front. She says "let's not tally around the guards." and she escorts us in with some haste. We're led down a couple of corridors and enter a bathing area (Turkish Bath). Some healers approach us as we enter the room. They bring a stretcher and ask us to set Ydil on the stretcher. Ydil is carried over to a bath and lowered in. Two healers enter the water and begin chanting and inspecting and other rituals. Quickari says "This could take a while, we should step aside." Barrow notices that one of the people in the bath wear a symbol of Lathander. Xiao also recognizes a symbol of Selune. Further looking by Barrow finds Lyra to be the third priest in the pool with Ydil. Barrow notices that they are casting Seed Heal (Epic spell). We are brought some supper, and after supper most of us eventually fall asleep. &nl;&nl;We awake to Quickari and some serving people bringing breakfast. She comes in stating that Ydil is dying. And that without his spark he has about 6 days before he dies. They offer to help us get to the Principality on the Plane of Elysium. Quickari hands Xiao a sack. "This is some traveling coin for you to help get you to Principality." (We receive 300pp). Barrow says that we're looking to acquire a Bag of Holding and a Belt of Healing. Quickari takes us to a merchant in a warehouse. We notice that we're being brought to a warehouse for the Free League. We are offered both items for 3500 gp. Barrow asks about Everlasting rations. They say it would be 350gp. Everfull mug is 200gp. "I have some news, there are rumors that other factions are looking to gain favor by assisting Ydil. And a babaloth came through and killed off Jeklith and carried of his body through a gate." Ydil wakes up for a brief moment and says  "Wide rivers" before losing conciousness again. We also purchase a cart to carry Ydil in, and a horse to pull it. &nl;&nl;We begin our trek to our portal to get to Elysium. We are led to a barn size door. Quickari takes a key out of her belt and hands it to Barrow. It has a crystal in it's handle. Quickari indicates that the key will take us through this door and into Elysium. I ask "And how do we get back?" Craig checks his notes. "This portal is a one way door, however, there are several different portals in Elysium back to Sigil. Ydil or his lords will be able to show you the way back." Barrow unlocks the door with the key and steps through. &nl;&nl;We emerge in Elysium standing between two stones in lush grasslands with deep blue skies. Nearby is a river splashing along a shallow bank. Sheep are nearby grazing. A pair of shepherds are near by. Lying in the grass nearby is a man with the symbol of a rising sun. This is the mark of a Transcendant Order. The two men seem to be digging a hole in the ground. One of them men pops up. They say "Welcome Travelers, I am Morn." the other says "And I'm Ryan." Xiao says that we'd like to take this man back to his order." Morn indicates that a creature came running through the portal and dropped this man here. Some conversation ensues about us taking the body to return him to the Transcendant Order. They allow us to take the body. Jaklim has some nice full plate armor with a nice longsword. Around his neck hangs a key similar to the one that we were given. We load him up into the cart to take him along with us. I ask for directions to Principality. The guys explain that we're basically on the border of Principality. "I would suggest getting him to the monks of the Accord. There's a monastary somewhere, hey, do you remember where it's at?" "Yeah, it's close, Go to Roll Clicking Crescent. It's an Inn, you should be able to find some shelter, food, companionship <wink>" As we are getting ready to leave, we hear a splash and screaming. One of the sheep has fallen into the river. Xiao races off and makes a great leap into the river. He slowly swims the sheep back to the bank as the rest of us get there to offer assistance. &nl;&nl;We begin our trip and find a building after a couple of hours. A sign hanging over the porch shows a Crescent moon with friendly features. We notice a faint cry and scream of terror. An old woman stumbles out the front door. "Please help me, if you're good and kind please help me!" We walk in to find 4 people alive, and at least 12 more dead. Xiao and Barrow spend some time trying to move some of the rubble out of the way. Starting with a large beam. The 4 people still alive help with Barrow. Willow is left with the cart. The group is freeing about 1 person every 15 minutes. The lady Astrid comes up to me. "Just after the monster killed everyone and began coming after me and my grand-daughter. It stopped. all I could feel from it was sorrow and guilt, and it felt like something was wrong and took off." After about an hour and a half I feel a piercing in my mind, feeling like something is trying to pull memories or information from me. I hear a voice say "Let me help. I must help. I must end the hurt inside." The babaleth has reached into my mind. I respond mentally with "Help how?" and announce to our group, "The babaleth is near." He responds with "I must give back the spark." I see the babaleth up on the 2nd floor about 30 feet from us. I jump up onto the cart to protect Ydil. Xiao heads back inside the Inn and asks Astrid where the Monks of Accord are. I also feel the emotions of sorrow and guilt through the mental link with the bebaleth. In addition I am sensing anger and frustration. Astrad says to "Head to lake Aonia. Maybe someone there knows how to find the monks." The bebaleth comes down and approaches the cart. I say "Stay back" he says "I'm giving this damn spark back." &nl;&nl;During the combat with the bebaleth, it took down Willow. After it took her down the creature fled as quickly as it could, I could hear in my mind "I'm sorry!" as it ran away. I went into the Inn to ensure that all were well and informed them that we would be leaving immediately. We began, with all haste, to find the Monks of Accord. After a couple of hours we come upon a lake. As we come upon the lake we see recent wrecakge of a fishing boat. We see three men, one which is moving, the other two dead. He describes an encounter with a giant spider monster. The man soon gurgles up, coughs and died. It seems like he has perished due to poison effects from the Bebaleth bite. Ydil woke while we were hear and said "Wide waters, East lake". He looked at and pointed towards the other side of the lake we are now at. &nl;&nl;We make our way around the lake and come upon a wagon. With the wagon are a family of humans. Xiao asks about the monks of accord. They tell us that they are a couple hours away in the orab hills. They describe how the beboleth helped them pull their wagon out. We continue our travels around the lake, in the general direction provided by the family in the wagon. As we come up over a hill we find ourselves seeing a monastary. As we approach the monastary, an abbot comes out. "Welcome, Welcome. I hear you've come to help the beboleth." he explains about helping the bebaleth, and that it is trying to "Who of you will carry the most important thing ever" I raise my hand. "Fill it with the waters of serenity from lake serene. Find the gem of harmony in the nest of the phoenix which is about to immolate itself. East of the Thighland hills. This has all been foretold. Place the gem in the calm water. Finally, all three must be taken to the center of the labyritnth of accord in Ornwood forest. When all involved successfully walk the maze with the items of accord, you will find peace and unity of self. Then, and only then, can the healing begin. You will need all, the Diva and Bebaleth." The abbot seems to have "summoned" the bebaleth. Barrow and Xiao notice that the bebaleth seems to be changing in color and it's carapace seems to be changing. "You are friends of the diva? I feel sorry, I need to help." I begin to ask my questions. "How can we find Lake Serene?" "Head down that path and think about it." "To move around in this place, the more good you are and the more good deeds you do, the quicker you move around in this place. Just think about where you want to go, and you will get there." &nl;&nl;The abbots take Willow back and heal all of her wounds. The poison fully removed. THey were only able to heal one of us a lot, or two of us a little. Barrow told them to take Willow. I ask the bebaleth what we should call it. He responds with "Merleck, Call me Merleck. Creature, what shall I call you?" I respond with "Aiven." He says, "You are all Aiven?" "No, I am Aiven." Barrow says, "I am Barrow" Xiao mumbles off something and eventually convinces Merleck that his name is Xiao. We begin our travels. &nl;&nl;After a couple of hours of travel we arrive at the Lake of Serenity. A man walks up to us and says "Why do you hide in that form? Do you think you can hide from me?" The human starts to shift form, getting wider, taller and sprouts wings. Combat with the new being trying to accuse our bebaleth of being a Diva. We narrowly defeat the Daemon who attacked us.&nl;&nl;We pick up a Large Great Axe with magic (+2) that the daemon carried. He seems to not carry anything else. We rest and awake. During the middle of the night, a bush sprouts containing 7 good berries.&nl;&nl;&lbracket;- 6 goodberries, -1 Action Point&rbracket;
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:4/5/2014|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:We wake in the morning and go through our abulations. We make our way up to the lake. As we approach all of us are filled with a feeling of tranquility until the silence is broken by the baying of dogs. A pack of wolfhounds are moving to position themselves between us and the lake. These are moondogs. One of them speaks up "Why are you helping the evil?" Humanish faced humanish hands instaed of paws. Conversation occurs about the babaleth and our journey to save the Diva. They say that they will meet us at the Labyrinth, there is interest in seeing the "birth of a new creature" with the Bebaleth turning good.&nl;&nl;Xiao asks for the chalice he dips the chalice into the lake to fille it over half full. After filling the water into the chalice, the water glows with a soft, warm light. We begin walking and thinking mightily about the Thieneland hills. After a couple of hours we seem to arrive at the place we are looking for. We come to a high mountain peak that looks out over the entire realm. We see all of Principality and we assume much of what lays beyond. A nest with trinkets is arest on the top of the peak. We see an ancient bird of great size and colors building at the nest with beak and talons. We begin dialog with the Phoenix about our quest. It asks for some items to replace the place where the gem of harmoy is in it's nest to keep the weave. After some discussion and offereing of items we get from it that we could trade some sweetfire herbs. Xiao remembers having these and presents them to the Phoenix. The phoneix says this will work and takes the time to weave the bag and herbs into the nest. It gives Xiao the gem, who hands it to Barrow. As we are departing "Remember, only a unified vessel can hold the diva spark, The gem could do this. Remember the three,Truth destruction and peace, that will see you through." &nl;&nl;Now we have all three of our items of accord. We begin our journey to the Labyrinth. After a few hours of traveling, we come to what appears to be a large forest. On the edge of this forest we seem a line of many people all over. Armored warriors of various races known to be defenders of good. I hear someone rallying the crowd against our bebaleth friend and we all hear a great cheer. Xiao offers to walk up to the host to find out what's going on and possibly redirect. Xiao leaves the party and strolls up to the host. They speak out "Drop your weapons" as he gets about 100 feet away. He drops all his weapons and announces "That's all of them, except for my fists, and i cannot drop those". "I hear you are misunderstanding of our cause." They reply "Wait for Dargus." After about 15 minutes a man comes up. "I am Dargus, peror of this realm. You are not from around here. Why are you here?" Xiao explains our quest. Xiao comes back to get the group after some negotiation. indicating that a moondog wants to speak with Willow. The moondog informs me that Willow would like to have conversations with me, weekly or more often if possible. Pleasantries are exchanged and we begin our treck into the forest.&nl;&nl;We find the forest to be much cooler, with many shadows. Ahead of us is a clearing to great blue sky. Living hedges in the clearing. We have reached the Labyrinth of accord. Color and lights flash in the bushes and a tall beautiful woman steps out, Immediately she pulls a hood over her head, She is recognized as a nymph. "Welcome to the labyrinth" and another steps out "You carry items? Have you come to walk the common path?" three more nymphs step out as we are here. "For hearts and minds" and she points towards the chalice "To hold that which can't be held" as she points to Barrow pointing to where the Gem of Harmony is stowed. "Choose an entry and begin the walk" "Keep goodness in your hearts and the path will open before you. Of course, you must pass the three tests." &nl;&nl;We depart into the maze, Barrow hoisting the Diva onto his shoulders. As we get deeper into the maze light is being sucked into the chalice and the gem. Soon after we see hedges fall away and the scene is replaced with a burning inn. Ygdil stands up "Who has my spark?" a person with glowing red eyes speaks out with "I have it!" all of the people standing around the building and state "I have it!" and begin chuckling and laughing. Ygdil passes out "I would never give my spark to evil." A child falls out of the inn. Xiao sparks forward trying to catch the child. He makes it just in time. Ygdil moves, pointing at Xiao. A figment of his spark flies from his finger and his Xiao. "I should have checked, I should have checked' and passes out. The scene fades again.&nl;&nl;The chalice and the gem now glow as brightly as a torch. We find ourselves back in the maze. We are now in some place different than where we started. We come to another dead end and the scene fades again.We find ourselves in a wasteland. Instead of soft grass, we are standing on a sea of bloated white skinned creatures (Maines) surrounds us. A set of Vrock show up and begin the slaughter of the Maines. Bebaleth wants to begin participating in the frenzy. The Vroke wade towards us slaughtering as the go. "Peace" I say. The vrock surround us. As soon as the first Vrock is felled, the scene shimmers and we find ourselves in the center of the labyrinth. Besides a shimmering body of water.&nl;&nl;I tend to bandaging Willow while Barrow offers healing to the members of our party. After about a minute, the bebaleth collapses. His carapace looks softer and lighter and he appears to have entered a similar state as Ygdil.Between the two is a glowing like a small sun glowing between them. Tendrils of light connecting to both of the creatures. Barrow puts the gem in the water of the pool. As soon as he does the pool begins to bubble and the gem turns hot. We see a foul and twisted creature emerge from the water. It's a much larger bebaleth. The bebaleth attacks one of the strings from one of the diva between the sun to the diva. The bebaleth cuts across one of the cords connecting to the Bebaleth. Barrow goes for the gem in the water, the bebaleth attacks Barrow. Xiao attempts to throw some of the water from the chalice against the spectre, it explodes into a giant ball of steam. Barrow plunges the gem into the glowing spark between the two creatures. The gem is absorbing the spark. A nymph appears out of the bushes. "Poison ravages the diva, but a different sickness ravages the bebaleth." Both of them are writhing on the ground, appearing to getting worse. "Something something withers without the spark to strengthen it". The nymph "The spark belongs to the diva, return it to him." Another comes out "blah blah give it to bebaleth" "The diva gaves it's spark away, he does not deserve it. Share it between them." Barrow considers this an option, and determins it may be possible. "No no no, the spark should not be divided. Let them both die so that the spark can return to it's power." "No no no, let them die is not the answer unless the death leads to new life." Barrow decides to split the spark between the two of them. The gem dissipates. Ygdil's eyes open wide and he shouts "No, the creature should not be allowed to die!" The bebaleth sits up, it's shell seems much healthier, glowing slightly rainbowish. Ygdil says "I must return to my power. You must help him walk the path of goodness." 4 small gems fall to the ground after the Gem of Harmony began to shrink and shatter. Bebaleth reaches out and picks one up, places it above his head. "I don't know what it is, but it's an Ioun stone." &nl;&nl;We feel a shifting occurring. We find ourselves outside of the Labyrinth, the host of folks are out there waiting for us. Barrow asks the bebaleth. "Are you still called Miralek?" "Oh no, I will now go by Abaya." Dargus comes up "Let's go back to the town? Everybody grab hands." We find ourselves coming in to a large city a couple of minutes later. &nl;&nl;&lbracket;-1 action point for L6&rbracket;&nl;
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:5/3/14|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:After some conversations, we identified that the Ioun stones can absorb 1d4 Charm/enchantment spells. Once they have been exhausted, they turn inert and become a diamond worth the number of charges x 1000 gold. As soon as we get back to Sigil, Xiao says "Hey, I'm out. I'm going to go start a monastery." and he departs. He hands Barrow the group funds (28sp) We head back to our respective churches and get back into our routines.&nl;&nl;We spend the remaining of our day in our temples. The morning comes. We go to the Inn and sit down for breakfast. A conversation happens between a kender and half-orc behind us. A man walks up to Barrow and I. "I'm here about a job". We ask him if he's looking for work, or hiring for work. He says he's on a job. "A story, about two tribes at odds." I notice the kender listening intently. "Perhaps we should take this conversation elsewhere"? "No, two battle cry, one chant of victory. The battle cry, Ico ico. The chant of victory, jacamophimyeh" We feel a wash of magic. We are washed over by a plane shift. We find ourselves, plus the kender and orc, and someone else standing in the middle of a desert. The story tell is conspicuously absent. I tell the group that I'm going to try something new. I give Willow a pat, hop down and wild shape into an Eagle. I fly up to get an idea of what's around me. I find what could be a settlement to our &lbracket;direction&rbracket;. I fly back down to the group and inform them of what I found. I discover that I'm not able to communicate as an Eagle and shape back to a halfling to inform them of what I found. We try and convince the serving maid that was transported with us, Sarah, that she should come with us. We will try to get her home. We set out towards the place I might have thought as a settlement.&nl;&nl;Walking through the desert we get ambushed by a giant scorpion who narrowly misses me with his stinger. During the combat I attempt to summon a trio of bears. Instead I summoned some medium bear-like creature. It has 2HD, natural armor (covered in hide and spikes), special ability bleeding (their mouth contains an enzyme that prevents clotting). Barrow and I went rummaging around the scorpion to find something that might be salvageable, we find on the stinger a crown covered in dirt and grime. I cast detect magic and notice the the crown does glow with weak magic of divination. Barrow suggests wearing it to see if we can figure out something about. We restart our walk towards the settlement. Walking through the desert is proving very tiring. Many of us are getting fatigued and injured. A few of the group hear some sand moving, a colossal centipede comes over the dune to my left. I identify it as a flame spawn. The flame spawn debilitates Barrow and Irk with poisons. Through summoning of some bears, lightning and lots of attacks from everyone, we take down the flame spawn. I take time to pull back the hide of the flame spawn to create a makeshift shelter to protect us from the heat and sun of the desert. Afterwards we all gather up together in the shade and I douse all of us in a shower of 14 gallons of water. &nl;&nl;I rest the remaining portion of the day while Ret takes watch. I allow him to sleep while i take the night watch. Fly up, see caravan, Lolarash. House Klethorath. They agree to give us a ride to the outpost if they can harvest the flame spawn. The caravan brings us towards an outpost. &nl;&nl;&nl;&lbracket;Add Ioun Stone, +3 Goodberries&rbracket;

When he approaches the caravan he immediately makes his way towards me. He asks where the forest is. I tell him I don't know. After some talking he, and his invisible friend, join the caravan on the way to the fort. As we approach the fort. It looks to be generally small, with a couple dozen buildings inside the fort. We are waved in by the local guard. The caravan approaches a center building. "There it is. I've got trading to do." We enter the building and see a number of people eating and drinking. As we walk into the establishment, everyone goes silent and begins to look at us. We ask for 2 rooms and meals. He asks for 11 ceramics. I pay him with a gold and 1 silver. He cups the silver and hands back the gold. He asks for another "white one" and I slide him a new silver. We determine that 1 silver is equal to 10 ceramics. And surmise that metal may be very rare around here.&nl;&nl;A gong goes off twice. A man comes in and claps his hands. Everyone in the bar stands and turns towards the same direction. Xenegoes says "you guys look like you cold use some entertainment." and he is quickly shushed. He pulls out his pipes. I whisper to him. "You don't want to do that" in sylvan and push his pipes down. Why don't you bow in worship of Hamanuh. You are not from around here? Hamanuh is the god king. Some conversation begins about where we are at. Hamunah and more. This area of the world is called the Table Lands in the world of Athys. We've been informed that our full plate friend would be killed on the spot. His armor is rare around here and he could easily be jumped for that. Go talk to the Templars if you're trying to get off world.&nl;&nl;Travel from dawn to about high sun. Cover up and rest at that point. Rest a couple of hours, wait till sun is perched, then travel on until Sundown, rest again. You may need a fire as it can get real cold. We all retire for the evening. In the middle of the night we hear a bell is rang three times. We hear people running around and up towards the wall. I talk to the barkeep after leaving the room. He tells me that it's raiders. This happens more or less normally. Not to worry about it and everything will be fine. After Barrow and I trade off watches, the battle is still going on 4 hours later. Though towards the end of Barrow's watch, the battle has subsided a little bit. &nl;&nl;We awaken the next morning and perform our prayers and some healing to get Barrow and Irk healed up. We come downstairs to get breakfast after all healing. We pay for our breakfast again and sit down to eat. Xenegoes asks about entertainment. The bartender lady says "Drink, that's about it" We help out a couple of bystanders who are injured and head to the wall. The barkeep says he needs every able bodied person to the wall. Tells us he wants us in the NE corner. We ask for him to point to NE. We head there.  Echo flies up to them to find that we are battling against elves. She also notices that their eyes have a faint red glow. An elf riding some form of dinosaur type creature enters the combat and is quickly dispatched by Irk. &nl;&nl;2 iron short swords, 25 ceramic, 19 arrows, MW Composite Longbow, MW Studded Leather, MW Bronze Scimitars&nl;&nl;Party Looted&nl;16x MW Bronze Scimitars&nl;16x MW Longbows&nl;16x MW Studded Leather&nl;2x MW Iron Short Swords&nl;1x MW +2 Str Composite Longbow (Barrow)&nl;1x MW Studded Leather (Magic) (Xenegoes)&nl;(9x4)+ (19x1) + (6x4) + (7x4) Longbow Arrows (divvied) (107 total)&nl;16x Potions (4x to Kendar), School of Conjuration (3 to all exccept Echo)&nl;40x Ceramics (10x Ceramics to Kendar) (6 each, 4 left over)&nl;&nl;Barrow has pale aura around him&nl;&nl;Dinosaur nail&nl;&nl;(-2 sp, +6 ceramics, +4 bits, -2 goodberries, -4 bullets)&nl;Xenegoes.
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:6/14/2014|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:We pick up all of the weapons and armors and drop them into Irk's bag of holding. The potions get divvied out, 3 each to Irk, Barrow, Xenegoes and me. As we're watching an older human male dressed in red robes comes up the wall. Barrow thinks it could be a Red Wizard of Thay. "I am Kallech, the fire cleric, who needs healing?" "Nope, nobody here." And he walks away towards the next group. The rest of the day passes without any event for us, though battle did rage in other parts of the city. As evening approaches, the group next to us has two members break off and come towards us. They are dragging an elf that's tied up. Ret attempts to speak to him in Elven while Xenegoes attempts to speak to him in Sylvan. Xenegoes "Oh, I speak elven" and he walks up and punches the elf. The elf says "If you let me go, I will lead you to my leader". The speakers of elven all recognize this to be a lie. He offers to draw us a map to his elven brethren if we let him go, stating there are about 80 of them a few hours ago. Some talk starts to occur about killing the elf, and letting him go. I tell them we're not authorized to do either. I ask Barrow to let me down and I start walking around to find the Barkeep/general person who asked us to take this part of the wall. I find the general and he asks if we can bring the prisoner to him. I get back to our group and Irk takes him over to where the general is. Yoda needed to be separated from the other dogs due to his incessant need to hump. After Irk gets back, the wind starts to pick up while we're watching the wall. We hear two long bongs and two short ones after the wind starts to get bad. People are quickly egressing from the wall and heading to the center of town. We all get down the rope and head towards the center of town. We crowd inside the inn with a lot of folks. Doors are barred and shutters are closed. The bartender is yelling out to the group. "Thank you for fighting, two drinks for everyone, on the house." The wind is howling and the inn is very loud. After some discussioin and questions about what's going on, we find that the elves have been drugged so that they are easier to control. They attack every once in a while. Information is proferred that Crescent Forest is to the east. Irk is offered a glass scimitar, magical, in exchange for his full plate armor. He also announces that it would work in a dead magic zone. &nl;&nl;The innkeep informs us that we'll be stuffed together into a room with about 7 other folks. We're all packed into the building cheek to jowl and the goal is to protect everyone from the sandstorm. The caravan driver and the innkeeper are arguging and pointing. The barkeep gets our attention and brings us over. "I have to apologize, I can't let you guys have the room. I have to give it to Belaresh. I can give you a space, but you'll need to keep a watch. Watch for like fires and breakins." Ret asks "What do you keep in here?" "Food and water." We set up the area into some defensible situation. In the middle of the night we hear a big bang that wakes me up. The doors are buckling. A humanoid elven shape is bashing in the warehouse door. Irk and Barrow run up to brace the door while I ask Xenegoes to go in to the Inn and inform them of the attack. Xenegoes gets in to the bar and tells the bartender "Elves are breaking in to the back door." and runs back to the warehouse. As he's turned around he hears "BANG!" behind him and the bartender barking out orders.&nl;&nl;Irk steps up and easily dispatches two of the elves. Upon cutting them down they burst into green clouds. Barrow curses out "ah damnit!" Barrow calls out to his deity and banishes the undead creatures. He drags in one of the creatures as Irk takes time to close the door, putting a makeshift block with the battering ram to hold the door closed. Barrow determines that these are some form of zombie that is diseased with some plague that is burst upon destruction. The zombie that we drug in had studded leather armor and a glass (red obsidian) dagger. After a couple of moments we hear a "THUD" on the roof. We look up to find the trapdoor and see it beginning to buckle. A creature bursts through the hatch, Xenegoes looses an arrow. A creature drops down amidst all of us. &nl;&nl;After more of the zombies break through the trapdoor and attack. Willow suffers from one of the bursts and she goes unconcious. Irk improvises a lock to replace the hatch with. He pushes it up and hammers a short sword in as a temporary wedge/lock. After a half hour, no more zombies show up. Irk checked on the inn and, other than many dead and diseased, the fighting was over. Most of us turn in for night to gain the rest of our rest. I ask Xenegoes to wake me at dawn so that I can ask Meilikki's favor. I heal Willow and Echo of their disease and heal Willow of her ability damage, bringing her back to consciousness. Barrow heals Echo of her remaining ability damage..&nl;&nl;Upon the duration of the day we all feel like we've changed in some fashion. &nl;&nl;Halflings&colon;&nl;Special Ability&colon; Psionic Ability (Missive 1pp) +3 power points&nl;Barrow&colon; Gain +3 power points&nl;Irk&colon; +3 power points, Prescience Offensive&nl;Xenegoes&colon; +3 power points, Call to Mind&nl;Echo&colon; +3 power points, Precognition Offensive&nl;&nl;Loot&colon;&nl;7x Studded Leather&nl;1x Red Obsidian Dagger (Barrow)&nl;&nl;(-4 bullets, -1 Action Point)
CHRONICLEENTRY:Y|CAMPAIGN:|ADVENTURE:|PARTY:|DATE:6/21/2014|EXPERIENCE:0|GM:|CHRONICLE:We all spend our morning guarding and experimenting with our new abilities. At about mid-day a patron brings us some lunch. The storm sounds like it may have let up by late afternoon. The barkeep comes in to talk with us. Gorgoreth says "Thank you for your assistance. I'd like to call on you for some further assistance. It should be on your way. You folks seem pretty strong and diplomatic to a degree. I was hoping that you could go to negotiate with the elves. If you could go to their camp and negotiate with their chief, see if we can end this conflict. Barrow asks "What are you willing to give up?" Gorgareth says "I am interested in knowing what their demands are." I asked if he still had the prisoner to exchange as a token of good faith and as a guide. Gorgoreth responds with "He ded!" Irk asks off about his manacles. I ask for some supplies to assist with the climate and the area. He offers to help supply us with what we may need to succeed. We converse cordially to identify the terms of the job. Travel till about noon, throw up the tent and rest for 4 to 6 hours then head on when things begin to cool down. One negotiated payment was free lodging and food while we stay at this establishment. Gorgoleth offers up replacement of reasonable costs. And we can further discuss compensation upon success of the missions. We ask for a large tent, Irk asks for a barrell. Gorgoleth offers up half a rundalet (9 gallon container) to take with us on our journey. We get two rundalets, a large (10 man) tent, some water skins. Irk is asking for directions to see Lolarosh. Barrow, Irk and Ret ask for miscellaneous items. &nl;&nl;We go to the clerics to purchase some components. in our dealings we are able to negotiate 20 gold pieces for 19 uses of diamond dust. Barrow asks for 10 uses. As the cleric steps behind the altar to get the materials I hear a form of casting. I was able to identify the spells as "Major Creation" and "Permanency" cast from the clerics. Irk ends up talking to a priest and working out to buy back his manacles. The rest of the day goes uneventfully at the inn.&nl;&nl;We head over to the temple to get our endure elements casting. I ask for another to be cast upon Willow. I ask for a casting of Endure Elements Willow. A second priest comes out and asks who needs the casting. Ret spouts off his mouth and next thing we know Lolarash and his guards are in the temple training weapons on me and asking who the spellcaster is. Irk is riddled with 4 arrows after refusing to put his sword away. They demand that I cast a spell to show them my magic. I immediately oblige and cast Detect. Lolarash's sword emanates moderate magic. They also ask me to have Willow cast. I tell them that she cannot. She's just a dog. After asking why Ret would say that she can, they believe me and round themselves up to leave. &nl;&nl;Out of game discussion indicated that the MW Studded leather we previously had as "loot" was unable to be carried by us. Backtracking to that point these were "donated" back to Golgorath for defense of the city. &nl;&nl;Follow the road north, you'll come across a larger road that comes across crossing East/West. Continue heading North Northwest. You should come to the elves eventually. It's about 16 miles away. The road is about the halfway point. We make our way north following the road for the day. Early evening we begin setting up the tent for camping through the evening. We setup a watch rotation. During the first watch, Ret is jumped by a centipede looking creature. After dispatching the creature I can clearly identify it as a type of animal, though I don't quite know what type. After about a minute after the battle, Ret's body seizes up and he falls. He is apparently paralyzed. I note that the centipede thing is poisoned and take the time to ask Meilikki to neutralize the poison. The remainder of the night goes on uneventfully.&nl;&nl;The next day we make our trek out, about half of the day goes by and we do not reach the fork in the road. After a time two insectoid creatures leap out from behind a dune towards us. The insects (Thri-Kreen) are brandishing weapons against us. One of them speaks out in a raspy voice "Oh, you're not elves!" Barrow asks "Are you hunting elves?" "We are on the hunt, for our next meal.' Barrow "You eat elves?" "Yeah.' Irk "They taste good?" "It's food". They two turn to each other and start emitting clicks and clacks back and forth to each other. One of them speaks out "Give us food" Ret offers up some form of ration and Barrow steps up to offer each of them a Goodberry. "Each of you eat one of these." "We no longer hunger. Back to our elf hunt." and the two walk away peacefully. After a couple more hours of travelling, we come to the fork in the road by about mid-afternoon. We get our bearings and follow Golgorath's directions. The night watches are set and the night passes uneventfully. &nl;&nl;On the third day the winds begin to pick up. &nl;&nl;(+3 waterskins 4 filled total, -2 ration, 2 sm ration -20gp +1900gp diamond dust)
