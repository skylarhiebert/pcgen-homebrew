DESC:Add some healing to your psionics with this first release in the Psionics Expanded product line! Divine power just not your style? Not interested in the bestial nature of the druid? Do you want an effective healing class without all the praying? The Vitalist is what you're looking for. This all-new 20-level psionic base class joins his allies into a single collective and then shares healing energy across it. Whether you're a mender, focusing on healing wounds, or a guardian who stops damage before it lands, or a soulthief who takes the life force of enemies and turns it into healing power, the Vitalist is the first true psionic healer for your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.
