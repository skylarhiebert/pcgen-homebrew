###Block: Faith the Brood of Torag
#SOURCEPAGE: p.22:
#Though dwarves honor Torag as the father and creator of all things, they pay equal homage to his family
#(with the exception of Droskar, whom most surface dwarves shun). Below are spells granted by each of these deities to
#the followers of Torag and his relatives. In order to prepare any of these spells, the caster must
#spend an hour performing a ritual in which he beseeches Torag (or a member of his family) for the aid of one of his
#divine family members. For 24 hours after the ritual, the caster may prepare spells of the requested deity. The caster
#may only attune himself to one additional deity at a time.
#
#TO DO: How to make sure only one of these spells is memorised?
