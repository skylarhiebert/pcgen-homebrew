All creatures within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately take 2d6 points of damage as their flesh melts and rots away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC %1 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC %2 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes her saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. This is a poison effect. Achaierais are immune to this ability|BlackCloudDC|BlackCloudDC

Soul Siphoning		KEY:Soul Siphoning ~ Aeon									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural				DEFINE:SoulSiphoningDC|0				DESC:As a swift action, an akhana can use its tail to siphon life essence from a grappled foe. At the start of the aeon's turn, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels (a DC %1 Fortitude save negates and grants immunity to this akhana's soul siphoning ability for 24 hours). When the number of negative levels equals the target's Hit Dice, the target's soul tears free from its mortal body and gets stored within the body of the akhana as a trap the soul spell. The victim's body remains preserved as if via a gentle repose spell for as long as the soul is held by the akhana. The akhana can keep the soul indefinitely, or can release it as a full-round action. Upon doing so, the released soul immediately returns to its body if the body is within 300 feet, at which point the body returns to life and any negative levels imparted to it by the akhana are removed. If the body is not within 300 feet (or if it has been destroyed), then the creature dies when its soul is released. A miracle, limited wish, or wish can force a displaced soul to return to its proper body. If an akhana is slain, any soul it contains is released automatically. An akhana can only hold one soul at a time.|SoulSiphoningDC							BONUS:VAR|SoulSiphoningDC|10+HD/2+CON						SOURCEPAGE:p.9

By concentrating, the pleroma can control this sphere, causing it to fly slowly at a speed of 10 feet per round. The sphere can travel in any direction, but must remain within 300 feet of the pleroma or it immediately dissipates. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (such as swamp, tundra, desert, or forest) or a 10-foot-square wall composed of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). Any existing matter, either living or nonliving that comes in contact with the sphere must make a DC %1 Fortitude save or be absorbed and incorporated into the new substance (only freedom, miracle, or wish can rescue creatures so trapped). Creatures that save are pushed to the nearest unoccupied location adjacent to the newly created substance.

By concentrating, the pleroma can control this sphere, causing it to fly slowly at a speed of 10 feet per round. The sphere can travel in any direction, but must remain within 300 feet of the pleroma or it immediately dissipates. The sphere is highly unstable and only lasts 1d4 minutes before harmlessly imploding upon itself. Alternatively, the pleroma may hurl the sphere as a ranged touch attack (with a 10-foot range increment) against a single creature. When thrown in this manner, the sphere implodes immediately after the attack is resolved.|SphereofOblivionDC																																	BONUS:VAR|SphereofOblivionDC|10+HD/2+CON						SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Any intelligent creature struck by this cone must make a DC %1 Will save or become nearly overwhelmed with the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in store for him. There is no way to make sense of these myriad dooms and boons, and as a result, the victim is staggered. As long as this condition persists, the victim may choose to make two rolls when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check, he must accept the worse of the two rolls, but in so doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul and he is no longer staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect, and as such can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment, the effective caster level of this curse is %2.|WreathofFateDC|WreathofFateCL																																																																	BONUS:VAR|WreathofFateDC|10+HD/2+CHA	BONUS:VAR|WreathofFateCL|HD	SOURCEPAGE:p.14

These attacks of opportunity do not count against the normal limit the creature can make in a round. Attacks that deal sonic or slashing damage do not trigger a reactive strike - rather, they cause the creature to split. Whenever a carnivorous blob takes cold damage, the creature cannot use its reactive strike ability until after it takes its next action in combat.	SOURCEPAGE:p.51

Corporeal Instability		KEY:Corporeal Instability ~ Chaos Beast		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC|10+TL/2+CON	DESC: Claw - contact (curse); save Fort DC %1; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom drain per round (see below); cure 3 consecutive saves.  A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a spongy, shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, helmets, and rings become useless. Large items worn or carried - armor, backpacks, even shirts - hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (�4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50%% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).  A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and polymorph) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange and stoneskin have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape - upon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases and the amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no further number of saving throws can cure the condition at this time).|ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC	BONUS:VAR|ChaosBeastCorporealInstabilityDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Corporeal Instability)	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(claw)

As a standard action, a charda can expel its full store of bile as a breath weapon that can take the form of a 60-food line or a 30-foot cone.  All creatures in this area take 8d6 points of cold damage (DC %1 Reflex half).
