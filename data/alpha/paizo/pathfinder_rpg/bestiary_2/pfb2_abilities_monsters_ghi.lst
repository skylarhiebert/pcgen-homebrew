This effect functions at CL 6th, and the target creature must be either willing or helpless (but still gets a saving throw to resist).  The save DC is 14 + the Charisma modifier of the jinkin with the highest Charisma score (DC 16 for most groups of jinkins).  Alternatively, the group of jinkins can attempt to infuse a magic item with a curse.  The nature of this curse is determined randomly; half of these curses make the magic item unreliable (each time the item is used, there is a 20%% chance it does not function), while the other half give the item a random requirement (see page 537 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).  A jinkin can take part in a tinkering only once per day, and may only tinker with a creature or object that isn't already cursed.  Once a tinkering curse is in place, it is permanent until removed via an effect like remove curse.  All jinkin tinkerings function as a curse created by a 6th-level caster.	SOURCEPAGE:p.142

On a hit, the ovipositor deals 1 point of damage and implants 1d4 eggs in the victim.  The eggs draw nutrients from the target's flesh, and give the target the sickened condition.  The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous gryph chicks that immediately burrow out of the victim's body.  This deals 2 points of Constitution damage per gryph chick, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away (if needed, use game statistics for a bat familiar to represent a hatchling).  Removing implanted eggs requires a DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit pont of damage.  Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation, remove disease, heal, or similar effects destroy any implanted gryph eggs.	SOURCEPAGE:p.150
