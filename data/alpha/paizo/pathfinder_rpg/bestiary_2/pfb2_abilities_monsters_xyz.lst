Redirect Spell			KEY:Redirect Spell ~ Xacarba	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural							DESC:Any creature that attempts to cast a spell within 30 feet of a xacarba must cast the spell defensively.  If the caster fails the concentration check to do so (or if the caster opts to not cast defensively), the xacarba can choose the target of the spell as a swift action.  The new target must be a legal target - if there's no legal alternative target to choose from, this ability cannot be used.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.288

Change Shape			KEY:Change Shape ~ Xacarba	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:You have the ability to assume the appearance of a humanoid with one serpentine trait, but retains most of your own physical qualities.																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.288																								BENEFIT:You have the ability to assume the appearance of a humanoid with one serpentine feature, but retain most of your own physical qualities. You cannot change shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than your original form. This ability functions as alter self, but you do not adjust your ability scores (although you gain any other abilities of the creature you mimic).  Since one serpentine feature is retained, the bonus to Disguise checks is negated.

Devour		KEY:Devour ~ Xtabay		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DEFINE:DevourSaveDC|10+CON		DESC:While a creature is under the effects of a xtabay's soporific pollen, the plant may, as a full-round action, occupy the same square as the sleeping creature and slowly sap the life from it.  Every round the xtabay uses this ability, the creature must make DC %1 Fortitude save or take 1d2 Con damage.  This feeding is curiously painless, and normally isn't enough to waken a foe put to sleep by the plant.  Each round this feeding continues, the sleeping victim can attempt a new DC %1 Will save to awaken.|DevourSaveDC		BONUS:VAR|DevourSaveDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Devour)				SOURCEPAGE:p.289

Each creature within a 10-ft.-radius burst centered on the xtabay must make a DC %1 Will save or fall asleep for 1d3 minutes.  A creature that succeeds on the Fortitude save cannot be affected by the same xtabay's soporific pollen for 24 hours.  A creature put to sleep by this pollen can be awakened by vigorously shaking the sleeper (a standard action) or by damaging it.  This is a mind-affecting sleep effect.|SoporificPollenSaveDC	BONUS:VAR|SoporificPollenSaveDC|2|PREFEAT:1,Ability Focus (Soporific Pollen)	SOURCEPAGE:p.289

###Block: Yrthak Abilities
# Ability Name					Unique Key								Category of Ability		Type								Description																																																																																						Ability																										Source Page		Aspects
Blind							KEY:Blind ~ Yrthak						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Weakness.Extraordinary				DESC:A yrthak sees and senses exclusively through its blindsight ability, which is based on sound and movement - beyond 120 feet, it is considered blind.  A deaf yrthak is effectively blinded as well except against adjacent foes - its weak eyesight functions enough for it to attack targets this close, although in such cases these creatures still gain the benefit of concealment (20%% miss chance) because of the creature's poor vision.  It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.
