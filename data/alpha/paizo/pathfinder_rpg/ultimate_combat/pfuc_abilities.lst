# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type									Required Ability									Var. Min. Value					Description
Breath Weapon Bomb*	KEY:Discovery ~ Breath Weapon Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural												PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),6	DESC:Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, you can draw the components, drink them, mix them within your body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from your bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = %1) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|AlchemistBombDC
Explosive Missile		KEY:Discovery ~ Explosive Missile	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural												PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),4	DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate.
Immolation Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Immolation Bomb	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural												PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),3	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater.
Nauseating Flesh		KEY:Discovery ~ Nauseating Flesh	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary												PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),12	DESC:The alchemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.
Poison Conversion		KEY:Discovery ~ Poison Conversion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary												PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),6	DESC:By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab.
Siege Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Siege Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Explosive Bomb	PREVARGTEQ:classlevel("Alchemist"),12	DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege weapon with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist's next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist's bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb's damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage (or another energy type, if the alchemist is capable of modifying his bombs in that way) each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.

Gunsmith				KEY:Gunsmith ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																																																					DESC:At 1st level, a gunslinger gains one of the following firearms of her choice: blunderbuss, musket, or pistol. Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it's worth 4d10 gp when sold). The gunslinger also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.

Grit					KEY:Grit ~ Gunslinger											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																										DEFINE:GunslingerGritPoints|MAX(1,WIS)	DEFINE:GritPoints|GunslingerGritPoints	DEFINE:GunslingerGritMax|WIS	DEFINE:GritMax|GunslingerGritMax	DESC:A gunslinger makes her mark upon the world with daring deeds. Some gunslingers claim they belong to a mystical way of the gun, but it's more likely that the volatile nature of firearms simply prunes the unlucky and careless from their ranks. Whatever the reason, all gunslingers have grit. In game terms, grit is a fluctuating measure of a gunslinger's ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a gunslinger gains %1 grit points. Her grit goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than %2, though some feats and magic items may affect this maximum. A gunslinger spends grit to accomplish deeds, and regains grit in the following ways.&nl;Critical Hit with a Firearm ~ Each time the gunslinger confirms a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level does not restore grit.&nl;Killing Blow with a Firearm ~ When the gunslinger reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, she regains 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the gunslinger's character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit.|GritPoints|GritMax																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Deeds					KEY:Deeds ~ Gunslinger											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																												DEFINE:DeedsLvl|GunslingerLvl																					DESC: Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longerlasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.

# Deeds:
Deadeye				KEY:Deadeye ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl1.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm's first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Gunslinger's Dodge		KEY:Gunslinger's Dodge ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl1.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Quick Clear				KEY:Quick Clear ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl1.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.10

# 3rd Level
Gunslinger Initiative		KEY:Gunslinger Initiative ~ Gunslinger								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl3.Extraordinary																																																																	DESC:At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if she has the Quick Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Pistol-Whip				KEY:Pistol-Whip ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl3.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and twohanded firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/?2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Utility Shot			KEY:Utility Shot ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl3.Extraordinary																																																																	DESC:At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot. &nl;Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell. &nl;Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally. &nl;Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.11

Dead Shot				KEY:Dead Shot ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl7.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, sheshoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7thlevel gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Startling Shot			KEY:Startling Shot ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl7.Extraordinary																																																																	DESC:At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Targeting				KEY:Targeting ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl7.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects. &nl;Arms - On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit. &nl;Head - On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. &nl;Legs - On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect. &nl;Torso - Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20. &nl;Wings - On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.11

Bleeding Wound			KEY:Bleeding Wound ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl11.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunslinger's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Expert Loading			KEY:Expert Loading ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl11.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Lightning Reload			KEY:Lightning Reload ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl11.Extraordinary																																																																	DESC:At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If she has the Rapid Reload feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Evasive				KEY:Evasive ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl15.Extraordinary																																																																	DESC:At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Menacing Shot			KEY:Menacing Shot ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl15.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Slinger's Luck			KEY:Slinger's Luck ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl15.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed's cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Cheat Death				KEY:Cheat Death ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl19.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Death's Shot			KEY:Death's Shot ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl19.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a critical hit, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a critical hit or making a killing blow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Stunning Shot			KEY:Stunning Shot ~ Gunslinger									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.DeedsLvl19.DeedsHasGritCost.Extraordinary																																																														DESC:At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Nimble				KEY:Nimble ~ Gunslinger											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a gunslinger gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunslinger to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunslinger to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). Bonus Feats: At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, a gunslinger gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained by normal advancement. These bonus feats must be combat or grit feats.

Gun Training			KEY:Gun Training ~ Gunslinger										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																										DEFINE:GunTrainingSelection|0																					DESC:Starting at 5th level, a gunslinger can select one specific type of firearm (such as an axe musket, blunderbuss, musket, or pistol). She gains a bonus equal to her Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Furthermore, when she misfires with that type of firearm, the misfire value of that firearm increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the gunslinger picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well.

Light Steps				KEY:Light Steps ~ Ninja											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.SpecialQuality																																										DEFINE:LightStepsLVL|0																						DESC:At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a fullround action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Hidden Master			KEY:Hidden Master ~ Ninja										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality																																																																			DESC:At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 ki points from her ki pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.



# Ninja Tricks
Acrobatic Master			KEY:Acrobatic Master ~ Ninja Trick									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.NinjaTrick				VISIBLE:DISPLAY																																																											DESC:As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can focus her ki to grant her a +20 bonus on one Acrobatics check of her choice made before the start of her next turn. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.
Bleeding Attack			KEY:Bleeding Attack ~ Ninja Trick									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.NinjaTrick.AttackOption		VISIBLE:DISPLAY																																																											DESC:A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the ninja's sneak attack. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns.

Most samurai belong to the order of the warrior and are dedicated to their lord. Those without a lord, or who chose to abandon their lord, are ronin. A samurai may instead elect to dedicate himself to one of the orders listed under the cavalier description (see pages 34-37 of the Advanced Player's Guide), but such samurai are rare. A samurai who wishes to change his order must undertake a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once he has accomplished this, he gains all the bonuses from his new order. The only exception to this is when a samurai decides to become a ronin. A samurai can elect to become a ronin immediately, losing all the benefits from his old order and replacing them with the new benefits from the ronin order. Once a ronin, however, the only way for the samurai to change to another order is through the method described above.

If a samurai making an honorable stand ever retreats from battle against his challenged foe, he loses the ability to make a challenge for 24 hours.

Demanding Challenge		KEY:Demanding Challenge ~ Samurai									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 12th level, whenever a samurai declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the samurai, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC on attacks made by anyone other than the samurai.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Greater Banner			KEY:Greater Banner ~ Samurai										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 14th level, a samurai's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against  charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the samurai can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benef it from this ability more than once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.20
True Resolve			KEY:True Resolve ~ Samurai										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 17th level, a samurai can spend uses of his resolve to avoid death. If he has at least two uses of his resolve remaining, he can spend all of the daily uses of his resolve that he has available to him to avoid death. Regardless of the source of the attack that would have killed him, he is left alive, at -1 hit points (or lower if he was already below -1), unconscious, and stable.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Last Stand				KEY:Last Stand ~ Samurai										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 20th level, a samurai can make a last stand once per day whenever he makes a challenge. While this challenge is in effect, all melee and ranged weapons deal the minimum amount of damage to the samurai, unless the attack scored is a critical hit. In addition, the samurai remains conscious and is not staggered while he is below 0 hit points. While using this ability, the samurai cannot be killed by melee or ranged weapons unless they are wielded by the target of his challenge. Attacks made by opponents that are not the target of his challenge deal no damage when samurai has 0 or fewer hit points. This ability has no effect on spells, environmental effects, supernatural abilities, or any other source of damage other than melee and ranged weapons. Such sources of damage affect him normally and can kill him (although they do not cause him to fall unconscious or to become staggered if they reduce his hit points below 0). This effect lasts until the challenge ends or the samurai takes an offensive action against a target other than the target of his challenge.

Honor in All Things		KEY:Honor in All Things ~ Order of the Warrior	SORTKEY:Order of the Warrior_1	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 2nd level, the order of the warrior samurai draws strength from his sense of honor.

He can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 2nd (maximum of five times per day at 18th level).

Way of the Samurai		KEY:Way of the Samurai ~ Order of the Warrior	SORTKEY:Order of the Warrior_2	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 8th level, the order of the warrior samurai's sense of honor and loyalty drives him to accomplish seemingly impossible tasks. The samurai can, as a standard action, focus his mind and will. Once during the next minute, he can choose to roll an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw three times and take the best result.

The attack deals the maximum amount of damage, although additional dice from weapon qualities, sneak attack, and additional dice from a critical hit are rolled normally. The damage from this attack ignores any damage reduction the target might have and also causes the target to become blinded, deafened, sickened, or staggered for 1d4 rounds (the samurai's choice). Making this attack is a standard action. The samurai can use this ability once per day.

Ronin					KEY:Ronin ~ Samurai Order										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SamuraiOrder.CavalierOrder																																																																	DESC:While most samurai belong to the order of the warrior, dedicating their considerable skills to the service of a lord, land, and people, some find themselves without a master, either as a result of disgrace or death, or occasionally by choice. Known as ronin, these samurai wander the lands, serving their own code of ideals. While ronin are significantly freer to do as they please, they do not receive the same respect and support that a more dedicated samurai can count on. Note that cavaliers can select this order, but they are typically called knights errant instead of ronin.&nl;Edicts: Ronin follow their own personal code of ethics and honor. As such, their edicts are extremely flexible and subject to change. Each ronin should determine his own edicts, which should include at least three provisions. These edicts are subject to GM approval.&nl;Challenge: Whenever a ronin is the target of a challenge, a smite, a quarry, or similar effect, and he issues a challenge against that character in return, the ronin receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four class levels the samurai possesses (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).&nl;Skills: A ronin adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills.&nl;Order Abilities: A ronin samurai gains the following abilities as he increases in level. 2nd level, Self Reliant; 8th level, Without Master; 15th level, Chosen Destiny																																																																																																																																																														ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Self Reliant ~ Ronin|PREVARGTEQ:SamuariaOrderLvl,2	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Without Master ~ Ronin|PREVARGTEQ:SamuariaOrderLvl,8	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Chosen Destiny ~ Ronin|PREVARGTEQ:SamuariaOrderLvl,15																																																																																																	CSKILL:Knowledge (Local)|Survival			SOURCEPAGE:p.21

Self Reliant			KEY:Self Reliant ~ Ronin				SORTKEY:Ronin_1				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 2nd level, the ronin learns to rely solely on himself, even in the most difficult of times. Whenever the ronin fails a Will saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, he can attempt another saving throw at the end of the second round of the effect. If he makes this saving throw, it has the same effect as if he had made the original save (negating part or all of the effect). In addition, whenever a ronin is brought below 0 hit points, on his next turn he can roll twice to stabilize, taking the better result.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Without Master			KEY:Without Master ~ Ronin				SORTKEY:Ronin_2				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 8th level, the ronin's fierce independence allows him to overcome staggering odds. The ronin can summon up this willpower as an immediate action, and can use it in one of three ways. He can use his willpower whenever an attack would reduce him to fewer than 0 hit points but wouldn't kill him, to instead be at 1 hit point and conscious. He can use his willpower after making an attack roll to confirm a critical hit in order to reroll the confirmation roll. Finally, he can use his willpower to take 10 on a skill check during combat, even if the situation or the skill would not normally allow him to take 10. A ronin can use this ability once during a combat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Chosen Destiny			KEY:Chosen Destiny ~ Ronin				SORTKEY:Ronin_3				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																																																			DESC:At 15th level, the ronin is the master of his own destiny. Whenever the ronin makes a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, he may roll twice and take the better result. In addition, once per day, the ronin can treat any one d20 roll as if the result were a natural 20. He must declare the use of this ability before the roll is made.
