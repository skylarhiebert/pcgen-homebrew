You can summon your eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, your eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned.

# Ability Name		Unique Key						Category of Ability		Type						Define								Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							Source Page
Fused Eidolon		KEY:Fused Eidolon ~ Synthesist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality												DESC:A synthesist summons the essence of a powerful outsider to meld with his own being. The synthesist wears the eidolon like translucent, living armor. The eidolon mimics all of the synthesist's movements, and the synthesist perceives through the eidolon's senses and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature. The synthesist directs all of the eidolon's actions while fused, perceives through its senses, and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature. While fused with his eidolon, the synthesist uses the eidolon's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), but retains his own mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). The synthesist gains the eidolon's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is sent back to its home plane. The synthesist uses the eidolon's base attack bonus, and gains the eidolon's armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. The synthesist also gains access to the eidolon's special abilities and the eidolon's evolutions. The synthesist is still limited to the eidolon's maximum number of natural attacks. The eidolon has no skills or feats of its own. The eidolon must be at least the same size as the synthesist.  The eidolon must have limbs for the synthesist to cast spells with somatic components. The eidolon's temporary hit points can be restored with the rejuvenate eidolon spell. While fused, the synthesist counts as both his original type and as an outsider for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for the synthesist. Spells such as banishment or dismissal work normally on the eidolon, but the synthesist is unaffected. Neither the synthesist nor his eidolon can be targeted separately, as they are fused into one creature. The synthesist and eidolon cannot take separate actions. While fused with his eidolon, the synthesist can use all of his own abilities and gear, except for his armor. In all other cases, this ability functions as the summoner's normal eidolon ability (for example, the synthesist cannot use his summon monster ability while the eidolon is present).	SOURCEPAGE:p.80
Fused Link			KEY:Fused Link ~ Synthesist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural										DESC:The synthesist forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the temporary hit points from his eidolon would be reduced to 0, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of his own hit points. Each hit point sacrificed this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon (thus preventing the loss of the summoner's temporary hit points), preventing the eidolon from being killed and sent back to its home plane.

Empathic Healing		KEY:Empathic Healing ~ Hedge Witch		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can minister to a diseased or poisoned target, redirecting the affliction into yourself. For a poisoned target, you must tend to him as a standard action; he makes his next saving throw against the poison as normal, but you suffer the effects of the failed save instead of the poisoned creature. For a diseased target, you must tend to the sick person for an hour; he makes his next saving throw against the disease as normal, but you suffer the effects of the failed save instead of the diseased creature. You do not actually become poisoned or diseased (and are not contagious and do not need to be cured), but suffer the effects of the affliction as if you had been. YOu normally use this ability to extend the life of someone near death, giving him time to recover. This ability has no effect if you are immune to disease or poison.	SOURCEPAGE:p.85
