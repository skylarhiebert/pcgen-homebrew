SOURCEPAGE:p.303																									BENEFIT:You can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).

Scent																						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Sense																																													DESC:You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.304																									BENEFIT:You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed--only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When you are within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location. You can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. When tracking by scent you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by your stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature.

SOURCEPAGE:p.304	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1d%2+%3, AC %4, %5 hp)|SwallowWholeDice|SwallowWholeDamageDie|SwallowWholeBonusDamage|SwallowWholeAC|SwallowWholeHP	BENEFIT:If you begin your turn with an opponent grappled in your mouth, you can attempt a new combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than you. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while you do not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 of your total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of your interior is normally 10 + 1/2 of your natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in your mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

The whirlwind is always 5 feet wide at its base, A whirlwind's width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. You control the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet and at most %2 feet high. The whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if you enter the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the whirlwind moves into or through a creature's space. In whirlwind form you cannot make your normal attacks, and you do not threaten the area around you. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the whirlwind might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (generally damage equal your slam attack) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC %3) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take damage as if it were hit by the your slam attack.

Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.|WhirlwindDuration|WhirlwindHeight|WhirlwindDC

A stirge has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached stirge can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself.
