If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.
Speak One Language									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural			DESC:A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability.					SOURCEPAGE:p.82
Spell Resistance				KEY:Spell Resistance ~ Familiar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC:A familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.									SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level + 5.
