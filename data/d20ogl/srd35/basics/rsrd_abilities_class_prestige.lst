###Block: Arcane Archer Abilities
# Ability Name		Category of Ability		Type						Visible	Define									Description										Modify VAR								Source Page					Description of the Benefits
Enhance Arrow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:ArrowEnhancement|0	DEFINE:ArrowEnhancementLVL|0	DESC:+%1|ArrowEnhancement							BONUS:VAR|ArrowEnhancement|(ArrowEnhancementLVL+1)/2	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).
Imbue Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES																															SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.
Seeker Arrow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:SeekerArrowTimes|0						DESC:%1/day|SeekerArrowTimes																SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).
Phase Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:PhaseArrowTimes|0						DESC:%1/day|PhaseArrowTimes																SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).
Hail of Arrows		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:HailArrowsTargets|0	DEFINE:HailArrowsTimes|0	DESC:%1 maxium targets %2/day|HailArrowsTargets|HailArrowsTimes										SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.
Arrow of Death		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES																															SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 10th level, an arcane archer can create an arrow of death that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an arrow of death, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The arrow of death lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.


#CLASS:Arcane Trickster -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranged Legerdemain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:RangedLegermain|0						DESC:%1/day (Su)|RangedLegermain																					BENEFIT:An arcane trickster can perform one of the following class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. An arcane trickster can use ranged legerdemain once per day initially, twice per day upon attaining 5th level, and three times per day at 9th level or higher. He can make only one ranged legerdemain skill check each day, and only if he has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.
Impromptu Sneak Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:ImpromptuSneak|0							DESC:%1/day (Su)|ImpromptuSneak																					BENEFIT:Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack). At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.

Save against Poisons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:AssassinPoisonSave|0	DESC:+%1 save against poisons|AssassinPoisonSave																SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:The assassin gains a natural saving throw bonus to all poisons gained at 2nd level that increases by +1 for every two additional levels the assassin gains.
Hide in Plain Sight (Assassin)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Internal				VISIBLE:NO															ABILITY:Special Ability|VIRTUAL|Hide in Plain Sight (Su)
Death Attack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack			VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:DeathAttack|0		DESC:DC %1|DeathAttack																BONUS:VAR|DeathAttack|10+INT	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
Poison Use					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES																														SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:Assassins are trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.

BONUS:SPELLCAST|TYPE=Arcane;LEVEL=9|-1																			SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:The archmage gains the ability to change arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level of archmage) that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level of the archmage plus 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell used to create the effect. This ability costs one 9th-level spell slot.
Arcane Reach							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HighArcana.Supernatural.SpecialAttack	VISIBLE:YES	PRECLASS:1,Archmage=1	PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=7	DEFINE:ArcaneReach|0	DESC:You can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to %1 feet away.|ArcaneReach															STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=2|NOCHOICE			BONUS:SPELLCAST|TYPE=Arcane;LEVEL=7|-1	BONUS:VAR|ArcaneReach|30*count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=Special Ability","NAME=Arcane Reach")|TYPE=ArcaneReach	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:The archmage can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away.

BONUS:SPELLCAST|TYPE=Arcane;LEVEL=7|-1																			SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:When the archmage counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as if it were fully affected by a spell turning spell. If the spell cannot be affected by spell turning, then it is merely counterspelled. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.
Mastery of Elements						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HighArcana.SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	PRECLASS:1,Archmage=1	PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=8					DESC:You can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses.																					BONUS:SPELLCAST|TYPE=Arcane;LEVEL=8|-1																			SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:The archmage can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The spell's casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting. This ability costs one 8th-level spell slot.
Mastery of Shaping						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HighArcana.SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	PRECLASS:1,Archmage=1	PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=6					DESC:You can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread.																				BONUS:SPELLCAST|TYPE=Arcane;LEVEL=6|-1																			SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:The archmage can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs one 6th-level spell slot.
Archmage Spell Power		OUTPUTNAME:Spell Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HighArcana.SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES	PRECLASS:1,Archmage=1	PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=5					DESC:Your effective caster level increases by +1 (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables such as damage dice or range, and caster level checks only).

Spell-Like Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:HighArcana.SpellLike.SpecialAttack		VISIBLE:YES	PRECLASS:1,Archmage=1	PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=5	DEFINE:ArchmageSLA|0	DESC:You permanently prepare the selected arcane spells as spell-like abilities that can be used twice per day.											STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLS|SPELLTYPE=Arcane[KNOWN=YES]	BONUS:SPELLCAST|TYPE=Arcane;LEVEL=5|-1	BONUS:VAR|ArchmageSLA|1															SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:An archmage who selects this type of high arcana can use one of her arcane spell slots (other than a slot expended to learn this or any other type of high arcana) to permanently prepare one of her arcane spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material component instead costs her 10 times that amount in XP. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot. The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level, although the archmage can choose to make a spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level. The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows her to use the spell-like ability four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets her use it six times per day. If spell-like ability is selected more than one time as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: The Dwarven Defender). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action.

If the spell requires a melee touch attack, the hierophant must make a ranged touch attack instead. Divine reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet.
Faith Healing								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hierophant.Supernatural.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES																																																					SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf								BENEFIT:A hierophant can use healing spells to their maximum effect on creatures of the same alignment as the hierophant (including the hierophant himself).

Gift of the Divine							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hierophant.Supernatural.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES				PRECLASS:1,Cleric=1																																														SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf								BENEFIT:Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to transfer one or more uses of his turn undead ability to a willing creature. (Hierophants who rebuke undead transfer uses of rebuke undead instead.) The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the number of turning attempts per day allowed to the hierophant is reduced by the number transferred. The recipient turns undead as a cleric of the hierophant's cleric level but uses her own Charisma modifier.
Mastery of Energy								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hierophant.Supernatural.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES				PRECLASS:1,Cleric=1																																					BONUS:VAR|TurnCheckUndead,TurnDamagePlusUndead|4	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf								BENEFIT:Available only to hierophants with cleric levels, this ability allows a hierophant to channel positive or negative energy much more effectively, increasing his ability to affect undead. Add a +4 bonus to the hierophant's turning checks and turning damage rolls. This ability only affects undead, even if the hierophant can turn other creatures, such as with a granted power of a domain.
Power of Nature								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hierophant.Supernatural.SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES				PRECLASS:1,Druid=1																																														SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf								BENEFIT:Available only to hierophants with druid levels, this ability allows a hierophant to temporarily transfer one or more of his druid Class Features to a willing creature. The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the hierophant cannot use the transferred power. He can transfer any of his druid powers except spellcasting and the ability to have an animal companion. The druid's wild shape ability can be partially or completely transferred. The heirophant choses how many uses of wild shape per day to give to transfer and retains the rest of the uses for himself. If the hierophant can assume the form of Tiny or Huge animals, the recipient can as well. As with the imbue with spell ability spell, the hierophant remains responsible to his deity for any use to which the recipient puts the transferred abilities.
Hierophant Spell Power		OUTPUTNAME:Spell Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hierophant.SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES																					STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE											BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|TYPE.Divine|1										SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf								BENEFIT:This special ability increases a hierophant's effective caster level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks.

Hierophant Spell-Like Ability	OUTPUTNAME:Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hierophant.SpecialAttack				VISIBLE:YES																					STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE=Spell-Like Ability																						SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf								BENEFIT:A hierophant who selects this special ability can use one of his divine spell slots to permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP. The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use the spell-like ability more than twice per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. If selected more than one time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

Shadow Illusion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:ShadowIllusionLVL|0						SPELLS:Class|TIMES=1|CASTERLEVEL=ShadowIllusionLVL|Silent Image,11+CHA											SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she can create visual illusions. This ability's effect is identical to that of the arcane spell silent image and may be employed once per day.
Shadow Jump								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DEFINE:ShadowJump|0	DEFINE:ShadowJumpProgression|0													DESC:%1 ft|ShadowJump|PREVAREQ:ShadowJumpProgression,0	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.
Defensive Roll	KEY:Defensive Roll ~ Shadowdancer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																									BENEFIT:Starting at 5th level, once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't attempt a defensive roll.

###Block: Thaumaturgist special abilities ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ability Name		Category of Ability		Type				Visible	Source Page					Description of the Benefits
Improved Ally		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:When a thaumaturgist casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and greater versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist's Diplomacy check adjusts the creature's attitude to helpful the creature will work for 50%% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature. The thaumaturgist's improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of alignment with the thaumaturgist. A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies normally.
Extended Summoning	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:At 3rd level and higher, all spells from the summoning subschool that the thaumaturgist casts have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to them. The levels of the summoning spells don't change, however. This ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.
Contingent Conjuration	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the contingency spell, including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly when the trigger event occurs. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a time.
Planar Cohort		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	VISIBLE:YES	SOURCEPAGE:PrestigeClasses.rtf	BENEFIT:A 5th-level thaumaturgist can use any of the planar ally spells to call a creature to act as his cohort. The called creature serves loyally and well as long as the thaumaturgist continues to advance a cause important to the creature. To call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an offering of 1,000 gp x the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can't be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can't have more Hit Dice than the thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist's character level -2. A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist's existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of the Leadership feat.
